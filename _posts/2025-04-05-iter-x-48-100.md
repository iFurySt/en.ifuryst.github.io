Day 4️⃣8️⃣

Today I’m showing a sneak peek (can’t share the video here~). I’ve progressed to the itinerary creation step, and tomorrow I’ll integrate the previous itinerary page. A small version is starting to take shape. These past two days have been super busy, but very fulfilling. I’ve also been heavily using some AI tools lately — it’s been amazing. I’ll share more when I get the chance.

Current progress summary:

1. Prototype design & UI/UX: 33%
2. Backend (Go) development: 40%
3. Client (Flutter) progress: 33%
4. Data: 10%

If you feel like you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. Committed
2. Dream-driven
3. Genuinely interested
