As expected, having influential people with strong traffic help promote the project had a great impact, leading to a rapid boost. However, the key lies in choosing the right direction and track ‚Äî only then can others immediately recognize the quality of your project. Choosing the right track and then working hard is crucial.

Speaking of which, Iter-X‚Äôs problem lies in its business model. Actually, I kind of want to ask Junyu Wang what he thinks about this [DOGE]. His project, ‚ÄúReading Room,‚Äù shows a similar shadow to what I‚Äôm experiencing. I don‚Äôt know how he thought through his product; I‚Äôve only seen glimpses of his journey through his articles. Somehow, I feel a one-sided resonance with him ‚Äî seeing a bit of myself in his experiences. Of course, it‚Äôs just a thought; I don‚Äôt really have a way to reach out to him.

I feel that from these couple of days until after May 1st, my project progress might slow down significantly. In a way, the next month looks pretty unpredictable. I‚Äôve been considering whether I should shift to building a long-term cycle product. After nearly 100 days of high-intensity push ‚Äî almost a 007 (work-life blend) commitment to this side project ‚Äî I‚Äôm thinking about finding a better balance, especially since I‚Äôm not ‚Äúall-in‚Äù on a single project.

Recently, I‚Äôve also had some new ideas about the product positioning. Perhaps this project can evolve toward the form of products like Devin or Manus, but with a strong focus on the travel field. It would allow for a gradual, progressive functional layering. Though this idea is not fully matured yet.

I‚Äôll keep absorbing a large amount of information, working on entropy reduction, and see what might eventually come out of it. üôÇ
