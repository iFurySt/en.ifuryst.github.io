Day2️⃣7️⃣

Today I’ve been focusing on the overall architecture and framework of the AI. The plan is to first implement the PlanAgent and streamline the process, so that the entire framework is thought through and other people can contribute based on this direction. I’m planning to stick to the previous design where we register multiple agents, and each agent can register a series of toolsets. This way, each agent can share tools when handling specific tasks. Currently, agents don’t communicate with each other, because the main goal right now is to integrate AI into the business layer’s various modules. Later, when we have a fully controlled AI, we will extract a main scheduling role in the business layer, where we can consider implementing multi-agent coordination to complete a task. This will also integrate routing gating. Overall, we’ll still follow a multi-layered architecture where the upper layers can repeatedly reuse lower-layer instances, and lower layers are treated as “atomic capabilities” by the upper layers.

Summary of the current situation:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 25%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 23%
3. Client (Flutter) Progress: 6%
4. Data: 6%
