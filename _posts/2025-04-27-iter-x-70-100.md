Day 7️⃣0️⃣

Today, I officially launched my open-source project on Product Hunt. The Day 1 campaign will begin tomorrow, April 28th, at 3 PM Beijing time. I’m hoping to make a strong push for the charts!
In just 12 days, I made 107 commits and released version v0.2.7. Before the era of generative AI, achieving something like this would have been almost unimaginable — nearly impossible. It’s a powerful reminder of how fast the world is moving forward, and how individuals are swept along, willingly or not, running ever faster.

As Dickens famously said, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…” — just like everything has two sides, it all depends on how you choose to look at it. Personally, I believe it’s the best of times — an era that grants individuals unprecedented “capabilities” and acceleration.
Unlike the internet era, which didn’t go through a chaotic early stage, the AI era has brought a real, palpable sense of chaos — but with it, an ever-expanding space for imagination and intensity.

I’ll be slowing down Iter-X development for the next couple of days. I expect to resume full momentum after the May 1st holiday, as I have some other commitments coming up. In the meantime, I’ll continue sharing thoughts and experiences.

Current Progress Summary:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 33%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 60%
3. Client (Flutter) Development: 58%
4. Data: 14%
