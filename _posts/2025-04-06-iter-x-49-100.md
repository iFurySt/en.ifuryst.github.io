Day 4️⃣9️⃣

Today was insanely busy—I even drove a round trip of 70 kilometers, which took four hours in total. Super packed. A friend also came by to chat about some interesting things, and I really appreciated that. I’m always open to talking with different people. Even though I only have 24 hours in a day, my efficiency and stress tolerance allow me to accomplish a lot—probably more than most people can handle. I’m also very confident that within my capabilities, I can bring different kinds of value to different people.

I’ve said this before: more and more people are realizing that the path forward isn’t linear—especially when it comes to career growth. Increasingly, people are seeking nonlinear breakthroughs and returns. I have some of my own experiences and advice to share:

1️⃣ First and foremost, you need to build your personal image. Maybe you’re someone great at design, or you’re skilled at building brand identity, or you’re a top-tier tech person. Whatever it is, you need to establish a “persona” for yourself. Of course, this needs to be backed by real skills—otherwise, it’s just a house of cards. Once you start collaborating with others, there’s no room for bluffing.

2️⃣ Secondly, don’t act solely out of self-interest. Collaborate with different people and create things together. Through repeated collaboration, you’ll learn more about who you are, meet diverse people, and gradually understand what role you play in a team and what kind of value you bring to the table.

3️⃣ Lastly, never stop learning. Strong self-confidence always comes from strong capabilities—or at least strong learning ability. Always stay grounded and confident, ready to take on all the known and unknown challenges ahead.

Haha, maybe this is getting a bit lofty and preachy—but hey, it’s all in good fun. I never encourage people to slack off, only to hustle hard. 🤯
