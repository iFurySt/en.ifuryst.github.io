    App Design Concept
</div>

Today I continued refining the client-side, almost finished filling in the gaps. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll start pushing pages. I was thinking maybe I should find some time over the next couple of days to also work on the personal page, which should be quick to finalize. Once that‚Äôs done, I can focus more on the modules and pages centered around the itinerary.

Reve.art gained some popularity today, and I tried it out‚Äîit‚Äôs still very effective! The free credits are being replenished quickly, and it‚Äôs great for exploring ideas. AI-generated images are really useful for inspiration, but finding the right direction still requires personal input. There are still some issues with style consistency, for example, generating multiple scenes based on one character often yields unreliable results. However, images and videos are certainly hot areas right now. I think many businesses could benefit from this, especially with platforms like Jianying, which deeply integrates this functionality, really increasing willingness to pay.

Current progress summary:

1. Prototype Design & UI/UX: 30%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 31%
3. Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 13%
4. Data: 8%
