Day1️⃣3️⃣

Today, I took half a day off and felt much better mentally. I also started reading a new book, Character Limit, which discusses Elon Musk and the drama between him and Twitter. He’s such a controversial figure. I’ve really been enjoying seeing the views and arguments on mainstream media and X (formerly Twitter) regarding certain topics—it’s fascinating to compare the perspectives of people on opposite sides of an issue.

Today, a new team member from the EDI (Engineering Design and Innovation) program joined us. They’ll be helping us with product commercialization and some solution strategies 👾. Our small team continues to grow.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is now up and running, and the data is starting to come in. Once we have better coverage in terms of countries and cities, we’ll begin the cleaning process.

    Safe Area for Phone Notch and Bottom
</div>

Today, I also made adjustments for the notch and safe area at the bottom of the phone screen, and I worked on the “Add Trip” page, although not all the modules are complete yet. I’ll continue working on it tomorrow. Help! I feel like I’m turning into a designer.
