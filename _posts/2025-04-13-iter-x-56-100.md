Day 5️⃣6️⃣

Sometimes I wonder if striving for perfection and obsessing over details is actually a bad thing. But after some self-reflection, I think it really comes down to balance—it depends on the context. When building an MVP, perhaps it’s better not to overthink every little detail. I should probably learn to hold back a bit so I can maximize progress within limited time.

Current Progress Summary:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 33%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 56%
3. Client (Flutter) Development: 47%
4. Data: 12%

If you believe you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. You’re persistent
2. You have a dream
3. You’re genuinely interested
