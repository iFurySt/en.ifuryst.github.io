Time flies so quickly—it’s already been 30 days, and we’ve completed 1/3 of the journey. Without realizing it, our small team has grown to 13 people. Today, some team members shared a few competitions, both AI-focused and startup-related. We plan to participate in a few and see how we can contribute. This also pushes us to quickly deliver some demos and prepare investment pitch materials. We expect to have a working demo this week; both the client and AI components are still being worked on. The team is deeply focused on the overall AI framework and ensuring everything flows smoothly. We aim to have everything up and running by tomorrow or the day after at the latest.

We should be launching an official account soon to post content, though we haven’t fully decided on the content production strategy yet. That’s it for now—back to work.

Current Status Summary:

1. Prototype & UI/UX design: 27%
2. Backend (Go) development: 26%
3. Client-side (Flutter) progress: 8%
4. Data: 6%

If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (maybe take a look at Day 6 for more context):

1. Can persist
2. Have a dream
3. Have an interest
