    Iter-X 1st Online Meetup
</div>

Today, we welcomed an interaction experience designer to join us, and now our part-time team has grown to 9 people. While the time and energy of each person may vary, and we can’t compete with full-time teams, I still choose to believe in the power of belief.

From the project’s perspective, there wasn’t much progress today. The entire evening was spent connecting with others. This weekend, we plan to hold the first online meetup for the core team, with a casual and relaxed tone. There will be roughly three parts: first, a chance for everyone to get to know each other; second, sharing backgrounds, initial intentions, and recent insights from discussions with various online communities; third, a casual chat about the future pace, collaboration, and overall direction of the product.

Today, I came across a quote from Poor Charlie’s Almanack from June 2021:

“The species that survive are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the ones most adaptable to change.”

I hope that in the AI era, we can all adapt to this new age. The tangible changes are already upon us and will continue to come, just like the saying in Alice in Wonderland, “We’re all just running to stay in the same place.” 🫡

Current progress summary:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 16%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 15%
3. Client (Flutter) Development: 3%
4. Data: 5%
