    1s Online Meetup Keynote
</div>

Today was the first online meetup, and it went smoothly. Everyone joined in, and we formally got to know each other. The team member from California stayed up until 3 AM to join us 🧑🏿‍💻. We aligned on the vision and ideas behind the product, as well as future plans. Several team members shared what they’ve been working on, and I truly saw the diversity in thoughts. I really liked the following paradigm:

Cross-age + Cross-region + Different Experiences + Different Abilities + Ideas + AI = ?

We have partners from three different age groups, with various experiences, backgrounds, and regions. Everyone has their own ideas, and at the intersection of the AI era, perhaps something great can spark. The product is just the vehicle, and AI is just the assist; what really makes things happen is turning great ideas into reality in the new context of this era (middle-aged + young people, old ideas + new ideas), and delivering them to people. The long-term value is the key—markets not only need profitable products but products that are valuable and useful to people.

To conclude: No app or project will succeed overnight. Enjoy the process, and pursue what you want. There’s no shortcut, just brainpower, persistence, and effort leading to success.

Let’s Rock! 🚀
