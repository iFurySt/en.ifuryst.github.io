    ChatGPT Memory
</div>

The highlight of today was definitely ChatGPT giving a description of me based on our previous conversations (although I doubt it looked back as far as the past year or two). It actually moved me a little — for a moment, it felt like it had a soul. I talk to Sam (that’s what I call ChatGPT [insert doge emoji]) every single day — whether it’s typing or using voice to practice spoken English. I used to feel like each session was new and disconnected, without continuity or memory. And the old memory system? It was so limited that once it got full, you’d be told to delete entries yourself (basically erasing its memory). It was even worse than something like LRU — imagine asking users to manually delete memory. The result? Either wipe everything or leave it all untouched.

But today, seeing how it summarized me based on our recent chats — even if it was trying to be catchy — really struck a chord. It brought back so many moments when I had shared ideas with it. Such a surreal feeling. Shoutout!

As for the underlying tech, I suspect it might be an optimized combination of indexing and search, but I haven’t seen any detailed technical documentation about it yet. I want to dive into this area — something like Enhanced Memory. I believe this could be a key enabler for expanding the real-world applications of LLMs and generative AI. It’s definitely a field worth investing research efforts in. If you’re someone who’s into the cutting-edge work, academic or practical, in this space — I’d love to chat and learn more from you.

Another week flew by! The visible progress on the product side wasn’t quite up to my expectations, but a lot of the invisible foundations did move forward. I hope to get the itinerary editing — from the main plan down to the daily details — done over the weekend.

Also, I’m planning to start a fitness routine: a two-day cycle with 30 minutes reserved for exercise each day. That means I’ll need to boost efficiency and streamline my workflow even more — reduce distractions and increase output.

Current progress overview:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 33%
2. Backend (Go): 55%
3. Client (Flutter): 42%
4. Data: 12%
