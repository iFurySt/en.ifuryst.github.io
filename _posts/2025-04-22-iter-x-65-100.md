Day 6️⃣5️⃣

Amap’s support for Flutter is honestly pretty disappointing — the latest version (3.0.0) is still from three years ago. Feels kinda rough. For now, I’ll make do with it and figure out a better solution later. The basic map rendering is more or less done. Currently, I’m using a simple “Day.N” format to represent point-to-point routes. In the future, I’ll replace those with POI stickers. Up next is adding functionality to insert and remove stops in the itinerary. After that, I’ll move on to the expense tracking module.

Time really flies. Things have been pretty hectic lately, and progress has slowed down a bit. On top of that, a lot of teammates have been walking away one by one. It’s a familiar scene — in the end, it’s rare to find people who truly walk the whole path with you. And that’s okay. I’ll tweak things and keep pushing forward.

Also, I recently open-sourced two AI-related projects, which got a lot of love from developers. I’m planning to carve out some dedicated time to grow one of them into a full-fledged SaaS service. That said, I’ll still keep iterating on Iter-X. I’m just not sure if the original milestones can still be hit on time. But since I’ve set off on this path, there’s no turning back — this is the commitment and perseverance needed to walk a road less traveled.

Mentally, I feel pretty great every day. Physically, though, my carbon-based body is having trouble keeping up. I went for my first swim of the year this afternoon, and I plan to swim twice a week moving forward. Gotta keep my body in shape to keep the output going strong. It’s late now — good night!
