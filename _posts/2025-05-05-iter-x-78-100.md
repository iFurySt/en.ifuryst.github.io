Day 7️⃣8️⃣

This trip has been incredibly rewarding—not just in terms of rest and relaxation, but also through the unexpected gains that came along the way. That’s part of what travel is about, after all. Though, to be honest, this wasn’t exactly a “regular” trip, since there were plenty of non-travel elements involved as well. I really experienced a lot this time. Fun fact: last night’s reflections were actually written after drinking, and looking back, I wasn’t even drunk—haha.

Interestingly, this trip also brought about some unexpected business opportunities. I think they’re quite promising—something like a positive feedback loop for the time and energy I’ve invested into AI over the past year or two. I believe we’re still at the early stage of AI’s penetration across different industries and applications. More and more opportunities will surface. The major players have their own strategies, while smaller players have a completely different playbook. Whether it’s toC, toB, or toG, each path has its own dynamics. I think the people or teams that can integrate capital, technology, distribution, business development, and marketing are the ones who will have a real chance to seize the moment in this wave. Just like the internet boom—it had a lot of hype and bubbles, but also unleashed massive opportunities and created long-tail effects that pushed traditional industries to go digital. The AI era is the same—it may come with bubbles, and some may burst—but the market potential is undeniable.

Even though what I write is mostly seen by a small group of tech folks, I remain open-minded and welcome conversations with people from non-technical backgrounds. If you’re in an industry and want to explore using AI to make something happen, feel free to reach out. Whether it’s a quick consultation or the possibility of deeper collaboration, I believe 1+1 can be greater than 2. It’s often the easiest way to create win-win situations.
