Day 7️⃣3️⃣

Holiday mode has officially begun! My open-source project has hit 571 stars so far — exactly 15 days since launch. Users are starting to integrate it and provide feedback, which I’m really happy about. I’ve set the next milestone at 1k stars, at which point I’ll start working on the Cloud Version, allowing people to configure and experience it directly in the browser. This stage will mostly be free to use.

After that, I’ll consider splitting out a commercial version. I haven’t thought too far ahead yet — I’ll decide once we hit the 1k milestone. The commercial edition is part of how I’m thinking about the project’s monetization. It’ll likely include some features that are not in the open-source version. Balancing open-source and commercial offerings is tricky:

- If you open too much, the commercial version loses appeal.
- If you open too little, it hurts adoption and community engagement.

This project has become a great case study in building efficiently in the AI era:

1. Stay sensitive to gaps in the market
2. Move fast — build and release an MVP in a few days
3. Launch within niche communities to get early feedback
4. Iterate quickly based on real usage

It’s a healthy product loop that fits the AI era perfectly.

Looking back at Iter-X, I do feel it’s moving a bit slow — though that’s partly because the to-C (consumer-facing) approach is fundamentally different and demands a higher baseline in terms of stability and design. Still, I’ve learned so much this time around. For example, it’s hard enough to find a solid full-time co-founder — finding reliable collaborators in the part-time pool is even more difficult. Analyzing it this way makes things more understandable.

Honestly, building in public has been amazing — it forces you to reflect and consolidate your thoughts. Even if the product I plan to launch on Day 100 doesn’t go live, I’ll have gained a ton of experience and growth just by going through the process.

By the way, I’m working on a new idea with a very clear revenue model (already validated in the market). I’m actively doing feasibility research during this holiday break. I might go the solopreneur route for this one. I’m not ready to share details just yet, but if you have strong hands-on experience and deep understanding of AI applications, feel free to reach out. If this idea works out, I’ll need long-term collaborators focused on AI at the application layer.
