Day6️⃣

Recently, I’ve been considering the Chinese name for the product. By the way, I haven’t introduced it yet—Iter-X. “Iter” is a Latin word meaning journey or path, and “X” gives it a modern and technological feel. It’s also a way to avoid issues with registering a single word or conflicts with others. As for the Chinese name, I haven’t figured it out yet. I considered “易途” (Yi Tu), which fits both in terms of pronunciation and meaning, but it feels a bit too common or plain, lacking a trendy vibe. So, I’ve hit a dead end with that. I’ve even thought about not having a Chinese name at all. Haha, let’s wait and see.

Recently, a few people have shown interest in joining. After considering the overall situation, I took some time today to write a “Collaborative Co-creation Initiative.” We are currently a loose team, all part-time. The product is still in development, and there’s no investment yet—no financial guarantees at this stage. However, I still hope to maintain an open attitude and welcome anyone to join at any stage. We’re not in an employer-employee relationship. Some join with passion, while others may quietly leave for various reasons. All of this is reasonable and objectively exists. Some come for social connections, some for experience, and some for that small glimmer of hope and idealism—whatever the reason, you’re welcome.

    Login Page & Trip Page & Design Color
</div>

I had a bit more time today, but I was busy with several things before getting back to the prototype and design. It’s already 11 PM, and after finishing this post, I still need to go out and grab some skewers for a late-night snack. Today, I worked on the login page and also made some improvements to the main flow page. Now, I plan to finish up the login-related pages first so that the client-side team can start working on their tasks as well. Otherwise, I’ll be holding up their progress. 😭

Here’s the summary of the current situation:

1. Prototype Design: 5%, I have some ideas now and am working with 2️⃣ to push this forward.
2. UI/UX Design: 5%, working on it.
3. Backend (Go) Development: 10%, we’re almost there, but this work is paused for now until we handle 2️⃣ and 4️⃣.
4. Client-Side (Flutter) Progress: 1%, waiting for 1️⃣ & 2️⃣ to be completed. Today, a new client-side teammate with experience joined us. 😎

If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. Can persevere
2. Have dreams
3. Are interested
