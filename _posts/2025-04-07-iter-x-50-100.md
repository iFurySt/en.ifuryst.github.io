Day 5️⃣0️⃣

The day has finally come — we’ve reached the halfway point. Looking back, 100 days initially felt like they would pass in the blink of an eye. But once the countdown began, I realized how long it truly is. After all, 100 days is almost one-third of a year — basically, an entire quarter. And what you can accomplish in a quarter depends entirely on your mindset.

The past couple of days, I’ve been feeling a bit off physically — a little tired, haha. Time to adjust and recharge so I can maintain high energy and efficiency. The road is long and the mountains are high, but I’ll keep moving with my heart.

Progress Summary:

1. Prototype Design & UI/UX: 33%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 42%
3. Client (Flutter): 35%
4. Data: 10%

If you believe you match the following qualities, feel free to reach out:

1. Persistent
2. Dream-driven
3. Genuinely interested
