As someone passionate about development, creation, and travel, I believe the intersection of interests is a great opportunity for innovation.

After a period of reflection and thought, I’ve decided to start documenting the birth of my new travel app product from today. I hope to meet some friends and even like-minded partners along the way.

Day0️⃣

Summary of the current situation:

1. Product’s English name, product concept, key features, and MVP goals have been initially defined.
2. Some back-end (Go) API development completed (authentication + main itinerary).
3. Client-side (Flutter) progress: 0%.
4. Conceptualized some prototypes, color scheme, and UI design.

I plan to share a project introduction PPT tomorrow.

Currently, we are lacking:

1. Flutter development partners.
2. UI designers with some UX knowledge.

If you think you meet the following conditions, feel free to reach out:

1. Persistent.
2. Dream-driven.
3. Interested.

Currently, we are all working part-time and are not looking for full-time team members. We are unable to provide any material compensation at this stage.
