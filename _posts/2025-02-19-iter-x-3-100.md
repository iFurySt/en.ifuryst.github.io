Day3️⃣

I stayed up all night last night, and today I’ve been feeling sluggish all day. I didn’t have time to check the latest news, so I just listened to the ALL-IN Podcast during my commute. I wasn’t feeling great and intended to rest early, but I ended up staying up past midnight 😪. The past few days, my side projects have been pretty busy, so it’s hard to find time for everything.

    The Nvidia Way
</div>

I’ve been trying to squeeze in some time to read The Nvidia Way. I’ve only got the last two sections left. Today I read about how Jensen Huang is a workaholic, and how the entire company’s atmosphere is high-pressure and intense. I feel a bit conflicted about this.

From an entrepreneurial or career perspective, it’s understandable that the founder is like this, and it could even increase the chances of success. I can relate deeply because I’m also a workaholic. But at the same time, as one of the many regular office workers, I can’t help but wonder if such “great” companies are really the end goal for employees.

I really value work-life balance. It’s not that I don’t want to work, but I think people should have space outside of work, whether it’s for family, solitude, or anything else they enjoy. All three words in “work-life balance” are important.

So, I feel conflicted about it. When reading that part, I guess I’m thinking from two different angles. If I look at it from one side only, I might feel strongly and defend my viewpoint. Maybe if my desire to start a business fades, I’ll start defending work-life balance more. Or if I succeed as an entrepreneur and become a boss, I might feel that not being aggressive and seizing market opportunities is a problem. But perhaps it’s not a simple black-and-white issue—there’s information asymmetry and trade-offs that come with decisions, and it’s hard to summarize in one sentence. Thinking dialectically helps you reflect on things. What’s important isn’t coming to a conclusion but the process of thinking 🐨.

    Prototype & BSing
</div>

Today, I still managed to make some progress on my project. I quickly sketched out some wireframes (+ made some rough UI design), but there are a few pages left to complete. I also need to dig deeper into the interaction logic and refine the UX.

Here’s a summary of the current situation:

1. Prototype Design: 3%. I have some ideas now, but it will still progress alongside item 2️⃣.
2. UI/UX Design: 3%. It’s started, but there are no substantial results yet. I had a chat with some designers about the color scheme and came up with some key terms (minimalist design, flat design, contrasting colors, Morandi color palette, high saturation, Memphis design, acid design, geometric shapes).
3. Backend (Go) Development: 10%. I have a handle on this, but I’ll be pausing this work for a bit to focus on 2️⃣ and 4️⃣ first.
4. Client (Flutter) Progress: 0%. Waiting for 1️⃣ & 2️⃣ to be completed, and in the meantime, I’ll be learning some Flutter~

I expect to focus on 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ over the next few days.

If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. Can persevere
2. Has dreams
3. Is interested
