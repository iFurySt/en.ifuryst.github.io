    Itinerary Page Design & Sticker

100 days have passed, and we’re already 1/10 through. Time flies. The biggest challenge for me today is the Revenue Model. Our product is destined to be a free product, so we need to think about how to survive during the early stages of development, as there will be no revenue for the time being. I’m also starting to look into angel investments, although we haven’t hit MVP or PMF yet, I think it’s reasonable to start thinking and preparing now. Once I finish the prototype and UI design, I’ll also begin working on the BP, as it will help organize my thoughts and clarify any chaotic or unclear ideas.

Today, we have a new team member who specializes in data and AI 😎. Now our team has more than one person working on each major direction, which helps with collaboration and discussions. However, I’m still hoping to find someone who can draw or create personalized stickers. If you’re out there, come hit me up (no need to be a professional artist—AI-generated images that you then modify are also totally fine!).

Today, I completed part of the daily itinerary design, and I’m actually quite satisfied with this version. I’m not from a design background, so I’m a bit of a self-taught designer, but I’ve learned some valuable lessons. One thing I’ve found is that in design, it’s common to end up scrapping everything you’ve previously done and starting over. I think this is a fairly frequent occurrence because you need to consider the prototype, UI, and UX all at once. In this situation, many ideas remain vague and chaotic, so it’s not always possible to settle on the final version right from the start. This process requires exploration and experimentation. I think that’s why I admire creators so much, including artists. It’s difficult to create something from nothing, but modifying something that already exists is much easier. So, I think this is normal. If you’re pursuing excellence, you need to focus on user experience, operational smoothness, and convenience, while also paying attention to aesthetics—making sure the design stands out and gives users that “wow” feeling. On top of that, you need to consider the implementation cost because many designs look great but are costly to implement.

Summary of the current status:

1. Prototype & UI/UX design: 10%
2. Backend (Go) development: 11%
3. Client-side (Flutter) progress: 3%
