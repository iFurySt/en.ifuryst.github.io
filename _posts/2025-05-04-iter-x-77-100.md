Day 7️⃣7️⃣

It was a fulfilling day, non-stop from morning till night. I visited several places, met many people, reflected on life and death, and had deep conversations about the ups and downs of life. Life is just a few decades—it passes quickly. Facing death helps us better reflect on how we truly want to live. Thinking about life’s highs and lows deepens our understanding of the chain reactions caused by key moments in life.

Worldly success is something we’ve always chased, but beyond that, there might be deeper things worth pursuing—though often, the former takes priority. Nowadays, many from the new generation are finding spiritual fulfillment as a way to counter material lack, which I see as a sign of progress on a spiritual level. Still, most people find it hard to escape the conventional pattern.

Back to routine tomorrow night—everything will gradually return to track, and I’ll keep pushing forward.
No pain, no gain — and I’m not done yet.✊
