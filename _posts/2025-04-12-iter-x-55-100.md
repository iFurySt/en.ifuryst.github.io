Day 5️⃣5️⃣

I realized there’s a bit of redundancy in the design I did earlier. On the itinerary page, the initial idea was to show a compact layout listing the POIs for each day, and then allow users to tap into a more detailed view—also organized by day. But today while implementing it, I noticed these two aren’t actually in a sequential relationship; they’re more like parallel representations—just different ways of displaying the same data. So I ended up separating them and adding a toggle. By default, it now enters the detailed view, but users can switch to the simplified one (though I’m starting to question if the simplified version is even necessary).

Designing really isn’t easy to get perfectly right—maybe it’s my half-baked skills, but many finer details just get overlooked in the design phase until you actually start building.

Today I discovered a pretty useful UI prompt generator. Comparing results, I found that many poor generations in the past were just due to poorly written or vague prompts. With this kind of tool, it’s actually quite efficient to explore design ideas quickly. I even feel that not every screen needs a full high-fidelity mockup now. I’m leaning toward describing some screens in natural language, generating a prompt, and turning that into a UI layout expressed in React code. After a few rounds of “pulling cards” (i.e., prompt attempts), if I get a decent result, I’ll just use Cursor to turn it into Flutter code and tweak it slightly. It saves a lot of time compared to mindlessly grinding through Figma. Of course, for critical pages, it’s still better to draw them out to avoid big changes during implementation.

Current Progress Summary:

1. Prototype Design & UI/UX: 33%
2. Backend (Go): 55%
3. Client (Flutter): 45%
4. Data: 12%
