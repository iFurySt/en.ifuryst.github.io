    AI for Trip Planing

The AI architecture and overall framework are complete, and an intelligent itinerary creation process is now running successfully. However, there are still some tasks to tackle:
1. Consider integrating MCP for further standardization.
2. Enhance observability—LLM calls need monitoring, including cost tracking, input-output sampling, etc., to support future Agent version iterations with data.
3. Strengthen boundary handling to ensure fallback mechanisms in certain scenarios.
4. Standardize prompt version management.
5. Optimize full-text search—consider replacing Elasticsearch with Postgres, which should be sufficient for a long time.
6. Improve Agents and Tools.

These tasks can be addressed progressively. Now that the framework is in place, AI engineers can focus on optimization, backend developers can implement logic, and data engineers can integrate data.

Current Progress:
- Prototype Design & UI/UX: 28%
- Backend (Go) Development: 30%
- Client (Flutter) Progress: 8%
- Data: 8%

🚀 We’re looking for a UI designer! If you meet the following criteria, let’s talk:
1. Committed
2. Ambitious
3. Passionate

Let’s build something amazing together! 👾
