    Map
</div>

I’m about to start working on the map feature — one of the most crucial aspects of trip planning visualization. For people with a strong sense of direction, like myself, displaying various POIs directly on the map is the most effective way to plan. Personally, once I look at a map and consider my available time and preferences, I can immediately visualize the entire trip’s flow and rhythm.

I especially enjoy saving interesting spots on Apple Maps or Google Maps. On the actual travel day, I decide what to visit based on the weather, mood, and time, making flexible decisions on the go. I see this as a nice balance between rigid planning and spontaneous travel. Since I have a good sense of direction and memory for places, I can mentally compute routes or even quickly adjust plans in case of unexpected situations.

But I know not everyone shares this habit or ability. What I want to provide is a way to use technology to reduce the cognitive load for people who find this challenging. For example, my partner is the complete opposite — she can’t read maps at all and totally relies on me as her personal GPS. If I can build an app that works well for both of us, I believe it can meet the needs of most people out there.

Current Progress Summary:

1. Prototype Design & UI/UX: 33%
2. Backend (Go): 60%
3. Frontend (Flutter): 52%
4. Data: 12%
