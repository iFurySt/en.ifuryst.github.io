Day 6️⃣3️⃣

The current map tiles don’t offer enough customization, so I’ll just make do for now. I’ve adjusted the overall color scheme first—starting with subtraction before addition. Making the map truly smooth and easy to use will definitely take some serious effort.

Today, I came across a sentence: “Netflix today is very different. It’s not a library — it’s an experience.”

While the original article had a different message, this line really resonated with me and sparked some thoughts. The idea is that Netflix used to be more like a library or a search engine—you’d come, find a movie, and watch it. Now, it’s become more of an experience. It uses your watch history, preferences, and recommendation algorithms to push content you’re likely to enjoy. In other words, the content is no longer the star—the experience is.

Of course, this is open to interpretation. For instance, in travel, many people have access to the same data—but is content what really matters? To a degree, yes. Platforms like Xiaohongshu have built strong ecosystems and moats around content. But when it comes to travel, maybe what matters more is experience. While today’s technology might not yet offer true end-to-end service, we can still deliver a solid user experience. Sadly, as companies chase profit and growth, this often gets deprioritized or lost.

Experience might actually be a key driver of user retention. It’s something worth reflecting on. Today, many indie developers are capable of creating functional products—tools that hit the “library” level of usefulness. But crafting a truly great experience is another matter entirely. That’s a crucial dividing line. With enough time and energy, many people can build a passable product—but standing out requires real skill, insight, and depth. It’s like that old saying: “Going from 0 to 60 is easy. From 60 to 100 is where it gets tough.”

Still, it’s not impossible. The resources we have at our disposal within a given timeframe are more or less fixed. What we can grow is our awareness, our exposure to diverse people and ideas, and our ability to stay grounded. In a fast-moving world, we can ride the wave of FOMO to maintain momentum, but it’s the “slow and steady” method that helps us weather the crash and deliver that one solid home run.
