Today has been a bit busy, and by the time I wrote this, it was already 12:30 AM. But I still pushed through to finish a simple slide. It’s still far from the business plan (BP) and roadshow PPT, but the focus is on conveying some ideas and design concepts.

Here’s a summary of the current situation:

1. Prototype Design: 1%. I have some ideas now, but it will still progress alongside item 2️⃣.
2. UI/UX Design: 1%. It’s started, but there are no substantial results yet. I had a chat with some designers about the color scheme and came up with some key terms (minimalist design, flat design, contrasting colors, Morandi color palette, high saturation, Memphis design, acid design, geometric shapes).
3. Backend (Go) Development: 10%. I have a handle on this, but I’ll be pausing this work for a bit to focus on 2️⃣ and 4️⃣ first.
4. Client (Flutter) Progress: 0%. Waiting for 1️⃣ & 2️⃣ to be completed, and in the meantime, I’ll be learning some Flutter~

I expect to focus on 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ over the next few days.

If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. Can persevere
2. Has dreams
3. Is interested
