Day3️⃣5️⃣

Today, I merged some parts of the client, and I did a little testing. It seems that the progress on the client side is still not quite enough. Over the next few days, I’ll dedicate some effort to addressing issues on the client side and also fill in the gaps on the backend API. The design work might be a little slower as a result.

Here’s an overview of the current status:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 30%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 30%
3. Client (Flutter) Progress: 10%
4. Data: 8%

If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to chat with me (we’re looking for a UI design partner 👾):

1. Perseverance
2. Dreamer
3. Interest
