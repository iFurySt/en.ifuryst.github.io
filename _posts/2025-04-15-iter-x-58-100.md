Day 5️⃣8️⃣

Not much progress today — I’ve been busy working on some MCP-related stuff these past two days. Besides building my own product, I’m also actively following the latest trends and what’s currently hot in the space. Lately, there’s no doubt MCP has been the breakout star. Even non-technical founders are FOMOing hard.

That said, I personally don’t think MCP is particularly technically challenging — that’s one point. Another is that, for most companies, it currently doesn’t have direct commercial value. However, it does carry some auxiliary value. For cloud providers in particular, MCP could offer strategic value, especially in driving sales of other products like compute resources. While it’s still a toB business for now, no one wants to be left behind in the FOMO wave.

I’m exploring directions where this could potentially generate real value. Even though I’m still full-steam ahead on building Iter-X, I don’t believe success comes from just one product or project. I believe continuous learning, hands-on practice, consistent output, and a cycle of accumulation and innovation will increase the chances of achieving success in the long run.
