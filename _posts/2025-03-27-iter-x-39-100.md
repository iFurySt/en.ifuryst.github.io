There isn’t any major progress update today, but our new UI teammate has started helping with some optimizations. Everyone is making progress in their respective areas, and we’ll push hard again this weekend. I also worked on the personal profile page a bit—this isn’t the final version yet, just putting in some content for now, and we’ll adjust the layout later.

Today, I watched Lei Jun’s 2024 annual speech, and it resonated with me quite a bit. Overall, I have a lot of respect for him. While he’s undoubtedly a marketing genius, I still found some really genuine moments in his talk—especially his approach to making cars. To truly understand the industry, he test-drove over 170 cars, borrowing them from friends, taking 4S store test drives, and even asking strangers in parking lots. He also led his team to obtain racing licenses, experiencing racing firsthand. Betting everything on one final startup, constantly learning and expanding his knowledge—this level of dedication is something I deeply respect. It’s about truly loving what you do.

He also mentioned a 21-day closed-door “argument session” with his core team, where they debated until they fully understood the direction before executing.

This is perhaps the mindset every entrepreneur should have—stripping away the unnecessary fluff and just focusing on getting things done. There’s no need for grand, empty slogans or overly complex processes. What matters is full commitment from everyone involved. Larger companies often suffer from bureaucracy, pushing employees to become hyper-specialized in their roles. But in a fast-moving team, we need people to be more versatile, aligning under a shared vision to build momentum.

Having a deep understanding of what you’re working on is crucial. Just like with our product—we need to first develop our own perspectives on travel before we can shape the product around those insights. Only then can we define our individual roles within this project.

I also came across some great quotes about travel while reading a magazine today, but I forgot to take pictures. I’ll jot them down tomorrow and share them!
