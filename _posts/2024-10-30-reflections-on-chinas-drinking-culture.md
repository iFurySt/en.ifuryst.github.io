Drinking like a bull might be a common stereotype, but it actually fits pretty well with reality.

In China, when it comes to drinking culture, we’re not just chugging down alcohol – we’re also sipping on human connections and, often, business interests. It’s just a plain, neutral observation – no praise, no criticism.

Take my area, for example. At the table, the host usually sits facing the entrance in the center. That way, they catch everyone who walks in first, and anyone entering will naturally notice the person sitting right across from them in the middle. Makes sense, right? Typically, whoever’s seated there is footing the bill. Pay attention next time, you’ll notice.

There’s usually a “drinking ritual” at the table, something like an initiation process, where everyone actively toasts each other, individually. There are two essential rules:

    •	It’s on you to initiate.
    •	And you’ve got to drink.

Generally, you start from your left or right and make your way around. It doesn’t count if someone else initiates with you. I don’t know where this tradition started, but there’s a certain logic to it. If someone comes to you for a drink, you’re likely to notice them. So, making the rounds and initiating a toast with everyone creates a chance to connect, signaling that you value them enough to raise a glass.

Now, a lot of folks don’t exactly love China’s drinking culture, and fair enough. It’s a bit like that saying, “Just look at the glasses on the table – every toast goes to the wealthiest.” It’s pretty telling about human nature. The drinking scene reflects social hierarchy like a mini society at a table. You can see why some people feel uncomfortable – it’s that hierarchy pushing down on them.

There are, of course, high-end gatherings where things are more refined, but drinking culture often mirrors broader social dynamics. There’s an odd connection between the society you’re part of and the drinking culture you find yourself in. It’s no wonder that many people feel a natural aversion to it. That said, everything has two sides, and within limits, everyone has a choice. Maybe one of the main reasons we keep hustling is to have a few more of those choices.

People have desires, thoughts, and the drive to choose their path. If you’re clear on your choices and can own them, then no matter if the situation is good or bad, you’ll be able to handle it with more ease. In the end, it all boils down to heart and confidence. 🍺
