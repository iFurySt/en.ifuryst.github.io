Day 6️⃣7️⃣

Marketing is crucial, especially in the early stage of a project. My two recent open-source projects both gained initial momentum by being shared in the right circles and platforms. They got in front of the right audience from day one. Then it’s all about expanding exposure—getting your product or project seen in more places. Even if it doesn’t attract attention immediately, it can have a long-term effect. People will gradually trickle in. What you need to do is keep iterating.

Even though these are just open-source projects, the approach is essentially a PMF (Product-Market Fit) journey. I’m learning a lot through this:

1️⃣ Good wine still needs marketing. A great idea may go unnoticed if you don’t know how to market it—and you might miss the window of opportunity.

2️⃣ Sometimes you’re not sure if your idea is actually a good one. But if someone gives you that initial validation, it can make a huge difference. And even if the first idea isn’t the one, it might evolve into something powerful. Often, you don’t realize its potential until later.

3️⃣ Speed is everything, especially in the age of AI. I keep telling my friends this: if you have an idea, just do it. Even a one-week delay might cost you the moment. The goal isn’t to build something perfect—it’s to go from 0 to 1. You’ll likely get something valuable out of it.

4️⃣ Build your own distribution channels. Think of yourself as the maker—but also the distributor. Channels matter.

That’s about it. Easier said than done, but action speaks louder than words.
By the way, someone influential tagged my project today. 🤞 Hope it brings more visibility by this Friday.

Honestly, I’ve been treating this #100Days challenge like writing a diary, haha. The truth is, I can’t always produce solid progress every single day. Sometimes my commits aren’t full features or polished modules. People are visual creatures—I get that. I’m not breaking things down into technical pieces on purpose. Also, I’m not a content creator, so I don’t have the skills to “cook up” flashy updates. I just share my thoughts and recent learnings—freely and casually.

Current progress:
• Prototype design & UI/UX: 33%
• Backend (Go): 60%
• Client (Flutter): 57%
• Data: 14%
