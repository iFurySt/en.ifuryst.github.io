Day 7️⃣5️⃣

A busy day—it started early with a morning flight and now I finally have a moment to rest. This year’s May Day travel wave is truly unprecedented. You can tell just from the fully booked flights and the skyrocketing hotel prices, many of which eventually hit full capacity. It’s even more intense than in previous years, clearly reflecting the continued growth of the domestic tourism industry. But it makes me wonder: how long can this trend really last?

From a market perspective, such high travel density during holidays seems unsustainable. Yet considering the limited number of holidays in a year, if not during these times, then when can people actually travel? It’s a contradictory situation: the cost of traveling during holidays keeps rising, while the quality of service or travel experience may not be satisfying. So how will consumers choose?

Let’s explore some potential solutions:

1️⃣ Develop more attractions to spread out visitors: Many regions are already working on this, but building up attractions takes time. Some locations can attract huge crowds through social media hype, but to make that sustainable, supporting services need to keep up.

2️⃣ Customized and personalized itineraries: As people visit more destinations, they begin to seek more unique and personalized experiences. This requires professionals in the industry to deeply explore and offer such services. This area is growing, especially in the mid-to-high-end travel market, since profitability allows for better service.

3️⃣ Outbound tourism as a form of crowd dispersion: From a national policy standpoint, promoting outbound travel isn’t ideal due to the outflow of spending power. But for individuals and businesses, it’s a lucrative opportunity—offering significantly different experiences at competitive prices can create a win-win for both consumers and providers.

4️⃣ Local and nearby travel (an extension of point 1): Encouraging urban or local tourism—like family-friendly countryside retreats—is a good way to retain travelers within their region. These can also attract consistent traffic on regular weekends, which helps boost local consumption and ease holiday congestion.

Although the global economy remains sluggish, the tourism industry is experiencing a strong rebound—especially after years of pandemic restrictions. The new generation places greater emphasis on personal experiences and is more willing to invest time and money into meaningful journeys.
