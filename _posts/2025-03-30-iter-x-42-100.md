Day4️⃣2️⃣

Today, I worked on a page. If I can keep up this speed, it won’t be long before I can finish the remaining pages. Over the next couple of days, I’ll need to supplement the backend interfaces. Since I stopped drawing every day, the progress has really picked up! It’s important to balance things out. For anyone considering independent development, there are a few things we need to handle for an app:

1. Setting up the code structure and basic framework (this is crucial, but if you have experience with past projects, it’s usually quick).
2. Product brainstorming — those with capability will output mind maps and wireframes.
3. Design work (depending on the size of the product, this can go quickly or slowly, but it’s a significant task).
4. Database design (for more complex products, this is a major job, but I usually produce this along with backend development).
5. Backend development (its importance depends on the product’s target scale).
6. Frontend/client-side development (end users are visual beings, while B2B is more function-driven).
7. Integration and testing, reviewing design implementation (details always take up a lot of time and energy, depending on the scale and whether you’re a perfectionist).

These are the main areas. If you’re not simply building a few pages or a design-focused product, as complexity increases, you’ll need to invest in all of these directions. It’s clear that for independent developers, building a team to handle all these aspects requires a huge amount of effort 🧑🏿‍💻.

Summary of current progress:

1. Prototype & UI/UX design: 32%
2. Backend (Go) development: 32%
3. Client-side (Flutter) progress: 19%
4. Data: 8%

If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner 👾):

1. Can persevere
2. Has dreams
3. Is interested
