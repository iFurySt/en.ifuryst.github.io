Day2️⃣3️⃣

We’ve started preparing to collect points of interest, which will include continents, countries, states, provinces, cities, and specific attractions. There’s quite a large amount of data, and the data team has already been dispatched. The backend team has also begun to provide the corresponding point of interest APIs.

The design progress is still a bit slower than expected, and in the next couple of days, I’ll need to align with the product team to finalize some ideas. For now, I’m thinking of releasing early and iterating. Over the next few days, I plan to have the client and backend teams work on some of the pages that are less likely to change significantly, so we can move forward progressively. This week, I’ll also be working on an architecture diagram for the AI side and thinking through the overall flow for AI interaction.

Here’s a summary of the current progress:

1. Prototype Design & UI/UX Design: 23%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 19%
3. Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 5%
4. Data: 5%
