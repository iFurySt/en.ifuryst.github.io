Day 7️⃣9️⃣

After some careful thought, I’ve decided to bring my Build in Public 100 Days series to a close. There are a few key reasons:

1️⃣ The number of viewers has steadily declined. I realized that a stream-of-consciousness style isn’t very engaging in the long run.

2️⃣ The priority of Iter-X has dropped for me. My other two projects are progressing faster and bringing in more tangible benefits.

3️⃣ I’d rather write independent articles moving forward. My current fixed-title format often limits how my better pieces are perceived and makes it harder to reach the right audience.

Given all that, I’ve decided to pause this series. Still, I’ve gained so much from the past 79 days — it’s been a rollercoaster, and I’ve made some great connections along the way. More importantly, it’s strengthened my writing ability, and I now feel confident that I can create even better content.

For those still following along, feel free to check out my updates on GitHub and my personal blog. I’ll be scaling back how much I share on social media. Instead, I’ll continue posting travel-related content there, while keeping topics like development, product-building, entrepreneurship, personal reflections, and tech/business insights on my blog. Social platforms often limit depth, and I no longer want to compromise on expression.

I’ll continue to stay active. I’m not the smartest or most talented person, but I do believe I’m one of the most persistent and action-driven. I’ll keep putting my ideas into motion — regardless of outcome, and without being tied to results alone.

The road is long and the mountains high, but I’ll keep walking.
