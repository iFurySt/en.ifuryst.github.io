Day3️⃣3️⃣

No significant progress updates today—I’m still evaluating options for full-text search and haven’t finished yet. I’ve realized that when working part-time, doing a 100-day continuous progress update can sometimes turn into a routine log, so I’ll try to avoid that.

I’m planning to host an AI sharing session this weekend. Some teammates are interested in AI but don’t have much exposure, so I’ll go over the current state of AI, possible developments this year, and real-world applications. If you’re interested, feel free to DM me.

Current Progress Summary:
1. Prototype Design & UI/UX: 28%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 30%
3. Client (Flutter) Progress: 8%
4. Data: 8%

If you meet the following criteria, let’s talk! (We’re looking for a UI designer 👾)
1. Committed
2. Dream-driven
3. Passionate
