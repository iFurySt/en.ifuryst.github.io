Day 7️⃣6️⃣

Every time I go on a trip or immerse myself in a life filled with real-world experiences, the rhythm feels completely different from the usual pace of building things constantly. My mindset shifts significantly.

Normally, my focus is on personal growth, consistent output, and the direction and progress of projects and products. In highly social situations, my mental space is taken up by interactions, leaving little room for deep thought. A lot of time gets reallocated to social engagement. During travel, most of my energy goes into experiencing and feeling new things, generating fresh insights and ideas.

Personally, I believe all three modes—building, socializing, and traveling—are indispensable. It’s just a matter of how I balance them, which in turn reflects what I value most. While socializing as an adult often emphasizes “meaningful connections,” I still enjoy the occasional spontaneous interaction. It provides a unique perspective and breaks me out of the fixed mindset that often comes with long-term focus on personal projects or commercial success. In that sense, it feels like a form of emotional compensation.

Travel is similar. I love traveling not just for the exposure to new experiences and perspectives, but also because different settings allow me to think from different angles. It doesn’t have to be deep—it can be novel and interesting.

These past couple of journal entries have felt more like personal diaries, with fewer updates on projects or product development. It feels like the Build in Public series is taking on a different tone now, haha. But I’ll Keep It Real. Regardless of where things stand on Day 100, this has already been a meaningful journey. I hope I can keep up the habit of writing—this positive cycle has noticeably improved both my writing speed and my ability to quickly capture and share ideas. It’s been incredibly helpful for turning input into output.

That said, Iter-X’s progress may have disappointed some long-time followers. I’ll take some time after the May Day holiday to reassess.
