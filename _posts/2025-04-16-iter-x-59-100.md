Day 5️⃣9️⃣

Finally wrapped this part up—smooth transitions are in place. Next up: refining some page features like add/delete/edit, then integrating the map functionality. Planning to use AMap for domestic users and Google Maps for international ones.

The past couple of days have been non-stop—barely had time to craft the app properly. I haven’t even started on the software copyright yet, which might make it tricky to get on Android later… but maybe just releasing the APK first is acceptable? [DOGE]
There are still a few screens left to design, but seems like no one’s helping with that right now, haha. I’ll keep pushing the visuals once I get through this busy stretch.

At this moment, the track reset-轮回者 (满舒克 / FatKan remix) echoes through my late-night workspace—perfectly fitting the mood. 👊

Current Progress Overview:

1. Prototype & UI/UX Design: 33%
2. Backend (Go): 59%
3. Client (Flutter): 50%
4. Data: 12%

If you think you meet the following, let’s talk:

1. You’re persistent
2. You’ve got dreams
3. You’re genuinely interested
