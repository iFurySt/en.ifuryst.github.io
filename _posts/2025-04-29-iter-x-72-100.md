Day 7️⃣2️⃣

The holidays are coming, and it’s time to get out and explore a bit. It’s been almost three months since I returned from the US for Chinese New Year, and I’ve been working intensely ever since. Time to enjoy some good food and fun.

I started this travel app 72 days ago because of my love for traveling—never forget why you started. That said, I really don’t enjoy crowded places; being stuck in a sea of people ruins the experience for me. That’s also why I especially love traveling abroad. I feel many people have the means to travel internationally, but in reality, only a small portion actually go—and even fewer do so consistently.

I want to shape this app into a platform for recording life experiences. Right now, most of our memories are scattered across notes, photos, videos, social media posts, and, of course, our minds. But it made me wonder: how do people generally treat their memories? Some people revisit beautiful moments often, some always look ahead, and some fall somewhere in between. I’m in the middle—I rarely scroll back through old photos or videos, but when I see something related, a memory fragment will resurface.

Sorting through travel photos and related memories takes a lot of effort, and I believe AI can solve a significant part of that pain.

Progress so far:

1. Prototype & UI/UX design: 33%
2. Backend (Go): 60%
3. Client-side (Flutter): 58%
4. Data: 14%
