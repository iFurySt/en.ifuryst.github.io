Today, I refined and organized the daily itinerary a bit. It looks good overall, but there are still some small details to add later. For now, I’ll stick with this version. Tomorrow, I’ll focus on finalizing the main itinerary. I also worked on some backend data structures today, and my teammate has finished some of the login-related APIs.

Today, a wonderful teammate joined who will be responsible for the product direction. They also have experience with AI and algorithms, so I’m looking forward to their contributions 😎

It’s Friday, so my mind is taking a break. Tomorrow, I’ll sleep in and then get back to work. Starting a business is a 007 job; your body and mind are always on the move. If you don’t have strong endurance, this path might not be for you. Have a great night 🌚
