Today, I set up the development environment and deployed the services, but the domain registration is still pending. It’s really slow. I started working on the date picker page today. Although it’s only Day 15, I feel like I’m not moving fast enough. In the past, I would dive straight into coding, but this time I’m focusing on conceptual design first, and the pace is slower. Hopefully, sharpening the tools will make the work go more smoothly.
