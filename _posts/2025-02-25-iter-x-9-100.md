    Itinerary Page Design
</div>

Today, things are finally starting to move. The frontend for the login page is nearly done, waiting on the backend APIs. The cold start ETL process has also begun, and we‚Äôll see what the data cleaning looks like with AI once it‚Äôs processed.

The itinerary page is still in the brainstorming phase. Currently working hard to optimize it. Here‚Äôs a half-finished version, but it‚Äôs still in need of some fine-tuning to stand out. It needs to be not only functional but also visually appealing, and I still need to think about the best way to present it üò≠

Summary of the current status:

1. Prototype & UI/UX design: 8%
2. Backend (Go) development: 10%
3. Client-side (Flutter) progress: 3%

If you think you fit the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. Can stick with it
2. Have big dreams
3. Are interested
