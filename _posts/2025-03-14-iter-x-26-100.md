Day2️⃣6️⃣

Today, I’m not even sure what I did the whole day. In the evening, I was tinkering with other things, and now it’s already 11 PM, only now I have time to look at things. Recently, the question about the future profitability model for the product has come up again. Given that it’s hard to make a profit in the early stages and it requires burning money to support the business, will we be able to survive long enough to build up the user base? It’s a very realistic issue, and that’s why many startups are aiming for a paid app direction. I think building a product itself isn’t that hard; the real challenge comes with the market and operations afterwards. A solid product foundation only helps, but it doesn’t cover up these issues.

Aside from that, I think international travel is a relatively less competitive market. Many apps don’t have a sufficiently good product for it. International travel is a growing market, and its scale will continue to expand, making it a worthwhile direction to invest in. However, international travel has a natural disadvantage compared to domestic travel, which is the lower frequency of trips. In the domestic market, we can focus on high-frequency travel, which increases the number of times and frequency that users engage with the app. So I believe it’s essential to combine both, leveraging the strengths of each, to offer a smoother travel experience in one app. Travel is something that lasts a lifetime, and I hope everyone who is physically and mentally on the road can slowly record and leave many memories and mementos. As you travel to more places, you can accumulate and experience more people and things, different encounters. I believe many people don’t or aren’t willing to put in the effort to document their trips through social media, but human memory doesn’t stand up well to the test of time. We may only remember certain things from five years ago, and many of them fade away, lying forgotten in photo albums or videos. Perhaps we can leverage technology and well-thought-out design to deliver a great platform that helps people record every significant journey for the long term.

However, vision, ideals, and aspirations need practical support. After climbing high and looking far, we must still walk steadily and take every step seriously. Not everything is about results; the process is something we should enjoy at all times.

Travel is never a matter of money but of courage. — Paulo Coelho

Back to the beginning, perhaps money isn’t our biggest concern after all—courage is. Knowing when to step back is modern wisdom, and courage to move forward is a unique trait of a traveler’s heart. ❤️
