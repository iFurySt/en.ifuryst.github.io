Today I organized the client app’s icons, name, and such, and also sent it out on TestFlight. Over the next couple of days, I’ll focus on infrastructure, and then we can start pushing the pages.

I feel that the loose collaboration style is not ideal. It’s already difficult to find people who can stick with it, and with part-time work, everyone’s time and energy are unpredictable. On top of that, continuous input is needed, which really filters out most people. But I think this is an interesting phenomenon. This is my first time trying to attract others through social media. Watching everyone’s evolution from initial idea exchanges to different behaviors as time goes on has been a fascinating process. I think this kind of collaboration, combining open-source principles with social platforms, is very dynamic and helps with learning. It further validates my idea that entrepreneurship can’t just rely on close relationships; you can’t naively assume that your good friends are the best people to work with. Instead, you should look for that “one in a million” person. Perhaps this also indirectly explains why there are more solo entrepreneurs — finding the right partners is not easy. Is this a bit pessimistic? I’m still optimistic. I have a strong ability to balance my own emotions and pressures. When you want to attract and lead others toward a distant future, you need to be strong enough to handle most situations. When everyone else falls, you still have to stand. If you don’t have this mindset, then just close your laptop and enjoy a 9-to-5 job, balancing life and work. No need to burn your life doing something you don’t enjoy.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about exploring further how AI can help improve my efficiency and productivity. A lot of what’s online is just demo-style sharing, but I’m looking for something practical that can actually assist. If you know about this and are willing to share, feel free to DM me 🚀
