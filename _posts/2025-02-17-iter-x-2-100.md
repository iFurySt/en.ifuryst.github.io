Day2Ô∏è‚É£

I saw something really interesting on HN today‚Äîit‚Äôs a way to display your life by weeks, marking significant events. Since there are only 5,215 weeks in 100 years (100\*365/7=5215), it provides a simple way to showcase key moments in life. I thought it was really cool.

My first thought was that I want to integrate this into an app! I hope to use this to show the travel moments of your life, with map visualizations that can easily evoke memories. It‚Äôs like how people enjoy ‚Äúlighting up‚Äù maps; I think it‚Äôs a similar purpose.

Todayü•ö, here‚Äôs a summary of the current situation:

1. Prototype Design: 1%. I have some ideas now, but it will still progress alongside item 2Ô∏è‚É£.
2. UI/UX Design: 1%. It‚Äôs started, but there are no substantial results yet. I had a chat with some designers about the color scheme and came up with some key terms (minimalist design, flat design, contrasting colors, Morandi color palette, high saturation, Memphis design, acid design, geometric shapes).
3. Backend (Go) Development: 10%. I have a handle on this, but I‚Äôll be pausing this work for a bit to focus on 2Ô∏è‚É£ and 4Ô∏è‚É£ first.
4. Client (Flutter) Progress: 0%. Waiting for 1Ô∏è‚É£ & 2Ô∏è‚É£ to be completed, and in the meantime, I‚Äôll be learning some Flutter~

I expect to focus on 1Ô∏è‚É£ and 2Ô∏è‚É£ over the next few days.

If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:

1. Can persevere
2. Has dreams
3. Is interested
