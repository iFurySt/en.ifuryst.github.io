Day 7️⃣1️⃣

Today, an old friend joined to help with the data part. I didn’t expect that someone would join at the final stage of the 100D journey. In the next couple of days, I’ll also review the data scripts written by other teammates. I did a quick test run today — the results look OK, but I haven’t checked the code implementation yet. I’ll work on integrating everything and set it up on the server to start generating some data.

Recently, I’ve realized that AI tools like Cursor are much stronger at writing React code than Flutter — you can basically “vibe code” effortlessly with React, but with Flutter, you still often need to manually fix things. I guess this is partly due to the difference in dataset sizes — React (JS) has such a dominant share on GitHub that no other language can easily compete. It’s a bit frustrating. I’m starting to wonder if developing clients with React Native might be faster and smoother. Maybe I’ll try building a small app with it next time and see how it goes.

Current progress summary:

1. Prototype Design & UI/UX Design: 33%
2. Backend (Go) Development: 60%
3. Client (Flutter) Progress: 58%
4. Data: 14%
