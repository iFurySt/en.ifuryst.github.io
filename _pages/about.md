👋🏼 Hey there! My handle is usually `ifuryst`, which doesn't mean anything special. 
It was a random concoction from my early internet days back in 2009 when I thought it sounded kind of cool. 
I'm pretty laid-back about names – call me anything you like, but for simplicity, let's go with `Leo`.

I've got a straightforward love affair with the internet that spiraled into a tech obsession. 
No fancy degrees here, just a boatload of curiosity and a knack for picking up all sorts of techy stuff. 
My interests are all over the place – not just online but in the real world too.

I'm your classic “workaholic” type, mostly because I can't sit still. Lucky for me, my job is basically my hobby, 
so it never feels like work. But, I've learned that there's more to life than just working and making dough. 
I'm on a mission to balance the grind with some good old-fashioned living. 
Stick around my blog for some tech talk and life stories – you'll see there's more to me than just a resume.

I love chatting with folks, so if you have any interesting or even boring thoughts, just shoot me an email. 
I'll be happy to respond, as long as you don't mind my patchy English. 👹
