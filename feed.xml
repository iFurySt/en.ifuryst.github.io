This is understandable; at the beginning, there are a lot of things to handle. After completing a few pages or APIs, many things can be reused, so the speed naturally picks up.</p> <p>Today, I was looking into Bluesky’s ATProtocol. Although I had seen it before, I hadn’t carefully examined its technical architecture. After reading an article analyzing it, I started thinking about whether a decentralized blockchain social platform could become the next big trend. After all, the Web3 buzz has been going on for quite a while. But on second thought, our travel app could also explore this direction. Although it feels a bit like a tech utopia, if the app doesn’t really take off in the future, I would consider fully open-sourcing it and integrating ATProtocol or creating a custom decentralized travel protocol. In this case, the app would simply be an AppView, a display carrier, and the data would be mostly consensus-based on the blockchain. Users would own their own data, which could be a fun and innovative concept.</p> <p>Last night, I recorded a screen capture of the current client situation. After doing a bit of hands-on work, I’m starting to get a feel for it. I look forward to recording another screen capture this week to share. Over the past few days, I’ve been receiving messages from new friends who are sharing or asking about features in the app. I’m happy to continuously receive private messages, and we actively consider many great suggestions. If you have any ideas, feel free to reach out to me for a chat.</p> <p>Summary of current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 33%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) development: 20%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we are looking for a UI design partner 👾):</p> <ol> <li>Able to persevere</li> <li>Dreamer</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4️⃣3️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 42/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-42-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 42/100days"/><published>2025-03-30T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-30T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-42-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-42-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4️⃣2️⃣</p> <p>Today, I worked on a page. If I can keep up this speed, it won’t be long before I can finish the remaining pages. Over the next couple of days, I’ll need to supplement the backend interfaces. Since I stopped drawing every day, the progress has really picked up! It’s important to balance things out. For anyone considering independent development, there are a few things we need to handle for an app:</p> <ol> <li>Setting up the code structure and basic framework (this is crucial, but if you have experience with past projects, it’s usually quick).</li> <li>Product brainstorming — those with capability will output mind maps and wireframes.</li> <li>Design work (depending on the size of the product, this can go quickly or slowly, but it’s a significant task).</li> <li>Database design (for more complex products, this is a major job, but I usually produce this along with backend development).</li> <li>Backend development (its importance depends on the product’s target scale).</li> <li>Frontend/client-side development (end users are visual beings, while B2B is more function-driven).</li> <li>Integration and testing, reviewing design implementation (details always take up a lot of time and energy, depending on the scale and whether you’re a perfectionist).</li> </ol> <p>These are the main areas. If you’re not simply building a few pages or a design-focused product, as complexity increases, you’ll need to invest in all of these directions. It’s clear that for independent developers, building a team to handle all these aspects requires a huge amount of effort 🧑🏿‍💻.</p> <p>Summary of current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 32%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 19%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner 👾):</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Is interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4️⃣2️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 41/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-41-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 41/100days"/><published>2025-03-29T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-29T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-41-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-41-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4️⃣1️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> GitHub Contributions </div> <p>Today, I was busy coding and really immersed in it. I was mainly working on the client side, and seeing the implementation on the real device was amazing. It felt just like transitioning from prototype to high-fidelity design, and it was very satisfying. There’s a creative sense to it, and as I’ve said before, I really enjoy creating. I think it’s an important driving force that can support you for the long haul. I checked my main repository and saw there have been 179 commits. Since Day 0, February 17th, I’ve been consistently pushing updates to GitHub. The fewest commits in a day was 2, and the most was 38. When you feel like you want to do something, build something, or even start a business, you need to ask yourself: can you keep going like this for months or even years? Why do I keep emphasizing the power of persistence? I don’t like it when people simplify everything with the phrase “choice is more important than effort” and use that to negate the value of hard work. If you look at most successful people, the majority are the result of hard work—there’s no shortcut. Going back to the earlier question: knowing is easy, doing is hard. I hope that the fire inside of you keeps burning, and that you don’t let the dullness of the real world easily put it out.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 32%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 18%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design teammate 👾):</p> <ol> <li>Can persist</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Have an interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4️⃣1️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 40/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-40-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 40/100days"/><published>2025-03-28T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-28T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-40-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-40-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4️⃣0️⃣</p> <p>At the invitation of KejiShu, I had an online chat with their operations team for nearly an hour today. We mainly conducted an interview focused on independent developers, shared some thoughts on the creative process, and discussed how there is now a wider variety of content on Xiaohongshu (XHS). They are also considering some future features. We even talked about the 18-image + 1K-word limit, which I think is a format that creators in certain fields inevitably encounter. However, this is closely tied to XHS’s product positioning, making it difficult to change.</p> <p>Overall, it was an enjoyable conversation. I love exchanging ideas with different people—many times, these interactions spark new and interesting thoughts. I look forward to seeing them provide more support for independent developers in the future and hope they maintain the platform’s overall community atmosphere and tone. After all, this could be one of the key motivations for many people to continue creating.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Mine Page </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Cursor + Figma to codes </div> <p>Over the past two days, I explored two AI-powered efficiency improvements.

I found the results and efficiency gains of the latter more significant.</p> <p>I’ve attached some images—by using the simplest prompts and just two iterations, I generated a 60%-complete page.

I’m happy to see talented people continuing to join us. Our two product teammates are also actively discussing ideas and defining features.</p> <p>One interesting aspect is that while our prototypes, design files, and development have all progressed to a certain extent, the complete product definition is still catching up. This is mainly because the product team joined later. Initially, I was the one conceptualizing everything, so now we’re running on two parallel tracks. However, I remain optimistic—most functional elements shouldn’t deviate too much, and UI/UX refinements can be adjusted quickly with some additional effort but still within a manageable scope.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 32%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 17%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, we’d love to chat!

Everyone is making progress in their respective areas, and we’ll push hard again this weekend. I also worked on the personal profile page a bit—this isn’t the final version yet, just putting in some content for now, and we’ll adjust the layout later.</p> <p>Today, I watched Lei Jun’s 2024 annual speech, and it resonated with me quite a bit. Overall, I have a lot of respect for him. While he’s undoubtedly a marketing genius, I still found some really genuine moments in his talk—especially his approach to making cars. To truly understand the industry, he test-drove over 170 cars, borrowing them from friends, taking 4S store test drives, and even asking strangers in parking lots. He also led his team to obtain racing licenses, experiencing racing firsthand. Betting everything on one final startup, constantly learning and expanding his knowledge—this level of dedication is something I deeply respect. It’s about truly loving what you do.</p> <p>He also mentioned a 21-day closed-door “argument session” with his core team, where they debated until they fully understood the direction before executing.</p> <p>This is perhaps the mindset every entrepreneur should have—stripping away the unnecessary fluff and just focusing on getting things done. There’s no need for grand, empty slogans or overly complex processes. What matters is full commitment from everyone involved. Larger companies often suffer from bureaucracy, pushing employees to become hyper-specialized in their roles. But in a fast-moving team, we need people to be more versatile, aligning under a shared vision to build momentum.</p> <p>Having a deep understanding of what you’re working on is crucial. Just like with our product—we need to first develop our own perspectives on travel before we can shape the product around those insights. Only then can we define our individual roles within this project.</p> <p>I also came across some great quotes about travel while reading a magazine today, but I forgot to take pictures.

It’s like that well-worn saying, “AI won’t replace you, but those who know how to use AI will replace you.” In the internet era, we used to say it’s no longer the time for big fish to eat small fish, but for fast fish to eat slow fish. I think this phrase is even more fitting for the AI era. The speed of AI advancements is beyond my imagination. I thought of the word “momentum,” which originally refers to kinetic energy in physics, but in news or articles, it’s often used to describe a project, team, or event’s development momentum. I think it’s a good fit for the AI era. While AI agents and MCPs are already last year’s things (I’ve thought about this: new technology takes time to flow from research to market, commercial, or public view. Many things last year were still in papers, and we’re part of the early adopters, so it feels a bit surreal and even confusing, but then it hits us—we realize the speed is just overwhelming), the applications emerging this year are coming faster and in greater numbers. If you can’t keep up, you won’t stay in place, but rather fall behind on the conveyor belt of time. The reason I work hard to absorb a lot of information, think, learn, and practice is to counter the rigidity that comes with age and experience.</p> <p>As for the team, today two new members joined, focusing on data and UI design. We’re now 15 people. Do you think that’s too many? Have you seen this kind of collaboration style? After the MVP launch, if I have time, I’ll write about the story behind this product.</p> <p>Here’s the current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 30%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 31%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 14%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner 👾):</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day3️⃣8️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 37/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-37-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 37/100days"/><published>2025-03-25T14:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-25T14:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-37-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-37-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day3️⃣7️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-25-iter-x-37-100/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-25-iter-x-37-100/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-25-iter-x-37-100/1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-25-iter-x-37-100/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null;

The free credits are being replenished quickly, and it’s great for exploring ideas. AI-generated images are really useful for inspiration, but finding the right direction still requires personal input. There are still some issues with style consistency, for example, generating multiple scenes based on one character often yields unreliable results. However, images and videos are certainly hot areas right now.

It’s already difficult to find people who can stick with it, and with part-time work, everyone’s time and energy are unpredictable. On top of that, continuous input is needed, which really filters out most people. But I think this is an interesting phenomenon. This is my first time trying to attract others through social media. Watching everyone’s evolution from initial idea exchanges to different behaviors as time goes on has been a fascinating process. I think this kind of collaboration, combining open-source principles with social platforms, is very dynamic and helps with learning. It further validates my idea that entrepreneurship can’t just rely on close relationships; you can’t naively assume that your good friends are the best people to work with. Instead, you should look for that “one in a million” person. Perhaps this also indirectly explains why there are more solo entrepreneurs — finding the right partners is not easy. Is this a bit pessimistic? I’m still optimistic. I have a strong ability to balance my own emotions and pressures. When you want to attract and lead others toward a distant future, you need to be strong enough to handle most situations. When everyone else falls, you still have to stand. If you don’t have this mindset, then just close your laptop and enjoy a 9-to-5 job, balancing life and work. No need to burn your life doing something you don’t enjoy.</p> <p>Recently, I’ve been thinking about exploring further how AI can help improve my efficiency and productivity. A lot of what’s online is just demo-style sharing, but I’m looking for something practical that can actually assist.

You input “3-day trip to Hangzhou,” and it starts planning. It even outputs the reasoning process of the model. I suddenly felt a bit absurd – the user just entered these five words, and AI is already thinking? It feels almost magical. It doesn’t even ask for user preferences. Is this kind of forced reasoning really thinking? I feel like many product teams today are missing the point. It’s like the famous story of Steve Jobs talking to his engineers. Today, many teams make the same mistake: they prioritize technology over product. Essentially, it’s “AI first.” In reality, we should start from the user. Only then should we think about whether this technology is needed, where it’s needed, to what extent, and what it can achieve. This is the logical direction to consider. Of course, I understand that FOMO, KPIs, and other pressures can lead to this approach, but just because it’s “necessary” doesn’t mean it’s the right approach.</p> <p>I even think we should let AI have a certain attitude. For instance, if you provide too little information, we shouldn’t recommend anything. Because it’s easy to recommend incorrectly, and the outcome could be: 1) The user feels like it doesn’t work and quits. 2) The user manually deletes the recommendation. 3) Or the user keeps asking AI to optimize it. Essentially, we’re wasting computational power, which equals burning money to satisfy unclear needs, guessing user preferences in a labor-intensive way, which is not productive.</p> <p>If we must force AI to recommend based on such limited information, that’s fine. We can go with a safer, more generic approach. This can meet the needs of the majority of users, especially those visiting a place for the first time. The chances are they will want to see the more famous attractions.</p> <p>Another point is that recommendations need to be justified. The reason for recommending a specific POI should be clear to the user because users have the final decision. For example, when browsing travel spots on platforms like Xiaohongshu or social media, you don’t visit all the top 10 places. You will only go to those that interest you. The key is understanding why something interests you.</p> <p>I still think we need to return to the original goal: start with a useful itinerary planner, then make it smarter. Many products today only focus on a direction or a few points, but what users expect is a complete product. We want to deliver this complete product. Now, I actually feel happier and lighter because the real concern for me was the financial pressure AI would bring. If we can get our approach right, maybe we don’t need such high upfront costs to validate whether the market believes in our vision.</p> <p>Current status summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 29%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 30%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter) progress: 8%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner👾):</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Ambition</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day3️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry></feed>
