Feels kinda rough. For now, I’ll make do with it and figure out a better solution later. The basic map rendering is more or less done. Currently, I’m using a simple “Day.N” format to represent point-to-point routes. In the future, I’ll replace those with POI stickers. Up next is adding functionality to insert and remove stops in the itinerary. After that, I’ll move on to the expense tracking module.</p> <p>Time really flies. Things have been pretty hectic lately, and progress has slowed down a bit. On top of that, a lot of teammates have been walking away one by one. It’s a familiar scene — in the end, it’s rare to find people who truly walk the whole path with you. And that’s okay. I’ll tweak things and keep pushing forward.</p> <p>Also, I recently open-sourced two AI-related projects, which got a lot of love from developers. I’m planning to carve out some dedicated time to grow one of them into a full-fledged SaaS service. That said, I’ll still keep iterating on Iter-X. I’m just not sure if the original milestones can still be hit on time. But since I’ve set off on this path, there’s no turning back — this is the commitment and perseverance needed to walk a road less traveled.</p> <p>Mentally, I feel pretty great every day. Physically, though, my carbon-based body is having trouble keeping up. I went for my first swim of the year this afternoon, and I plan to swim twice a week moving forward. Gotta keep my body in shape to keep the output going strong.

Today I’ve been calibrating the transformation from WGS84 to GCJ02 coordinate systems. Some of the previous data had location inaccuracies, so I’m adjusting the logic to fix it. Hopefully I can finish refining the scripts this week and start large-scale POI processing. Related images are also being crawled, and will later be uploaded in batches to OSS.</p> <p>When dealing with images and videos, the two most costly factors are usually: 1. Storage and 2. Bandwidth. Storage tends to be cheaper, and we can optimize costs by implementing cold/hot storage separation. But bandwidth is where costs can spiral, so we pay extra attention there.</p> <p>Typically, we generate several thumbnail versions of each image. In most cases, a thumbnail of just a few dozen KB is sufficient, especially on mobile screens. With lossless compression, we can reduce file sizes of high-res images significantly. And we can even sacrifice some resolution without noticeable impact to the human eye — unless you zoom in. That’s why we strike a balance between visual quality and cost by generating a few common thumbnail sizes.</p> <p>Some systems even support on-the-fly image resizing via URL parameters. This avoids the need to store multiple versions, though it requires generating images in real-time. However, if paired with a CDN, you only need to generate the image on the first request, which is totally acceptable. There’s no silver bullet — only solutions that best match your scenario and budget.</p> <p>Progress so far:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 55%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>⸻</p> <p>If you identify with the following, let’s talk:</p> <ol> <li>You’re persistent</li> <li>You’ve got dreams</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 6️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 63/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-63-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 63/100days"/><published>2025-04-20T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-20T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-63-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-63-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 6️⃣3️⃣</p> <p>The current map tiles don’t offer enough customization, so I’ll just make do for now. I’ve adjusted the overall color scheme first—starting with subtraction before addition. Making the map truly smooth and easy to use will definitely take some serious effort.</p> <p>Today, I came across a sentence: “Netflix today is very different. It’s not a library — it’s an experience.”</p> <p>While the original article had a different message, this line really resonated with me and sparked some thoughts. The idea is that Netflix used to be more like a library or a search engine—you’d come, find a movie, and watch it. Now, it’s become more of an experience. It uses your watch history, preferences, and recommendation algorithms to push content you’re likely to enjoy. In other words, the content is no longer the star—the experience is.</p> <p>Of course, this is open to interpretation. For instance, in travel, many people have access to the same data—but is content what really matters? To a degree, yes. Platforms like Xiaohongshu have built strong ecosystems and moats around content. But when it comes to travel, maybe what matters more is experience. While today’s technology might not yet offer true end-to-end service, we can still deliver a solid user experience. Sadly, as companies chase profit and growth, this often gets deprioritized or lost.</p> <p>Experience might actually be a key driver of user retention. It’s something worth reflecting on. Today, many indie developers are capable of creating functional products—tools that hit the “library” level of usefulness. But crafting a truly great experience is another matter entirely. That’s a crucial dividing line. With enough time and energy, many people can build a passable product—but standing out requires real skill, insight, and depth. It’s like that old saying: “Going from 0 to 60 is easy. From 60 to 100 is where it gets tough.”</p> <p>Still, it’s not impossible. The resources we have at our disposal within a given timeframe are more or less fixed. What we can grow is our awareness, our exposure to diverse people and ideas, and our ability to stay grounded. In a fast-moving world, we can ride the wave of FOMO to maintain momentum, but it’s the “slow and steady” method that helps us weather the crash and deliver that one solid home run.</p> <p>Just Fk**ing Do It.</p> <p>⸻</p> <p>Progress so far:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 54%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>⸻</p> <p>If you resonate with the following, let’s chat:</p> <ol> <li>You’re persistent</li> <li>You have dreams</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 6️⃣3️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 62/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-62-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 62/100days"/><published>2025-04-19T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-19T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-62-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-62-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 6️⃣2️⃣</p> <p>These past two days, I’ve been watching the first developer competition held by Xiaohongshu, and it got me thinking. I feel like indie developers and indie game developers are quite similar groups. The former probably has a larger population right now, but their survival rate is much lower. It’s a harsh reality—indie game devs can at least build interesting games and monetize directly through one-time purchases. For most indie app developers, though, it’s hard to earn more than what you’d get from a regular job. Some great apps can easily get “honored” by big companies, crushed by competition, or simply die in the early stages. The ones that make it out are rare.</p> <p>It’s kind of surreal. Vibe Coding is becoming more popular now, and you can see a lot of solo devs creating cool apps, but most of them are driven by passion or a desire to create, not profit. B2C is brutally tough; B2B, on the other hand, is very reliant on business skills and connections.</p> <p>This brings up the question: why do so many people still throw themselves into this path? Where do they end up? Maybe I can glimpse a bit of the answer through my own story, though one person’s experience probably doesn’t speak for the majority.</p> <p>I think it’s both a process and an experience. I’ve built many products in the past and provided product development services for individuals and businesses. In my case, the most profitable ones have always been B2B. I wonder if others feel the same. I’ve always had this itch to create (a chronic itch that’s long overdue for treatment), and I keep dreaming of building something truly great. If it brings fame or fortune, even better—that’s part of what keeps driving me to throw myself into new projects.</p> <p>Ironically, I recently stumbled upon an old GitHub and blog intro I wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m into the internet, traveling, reading, and listening to music – still figuring out this whole “living life” thing.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I’m on a mission to balance the grind with some good old-fashioned living.</p> </blockquote> <p>And recently while chatting with a friend, we joked: maybe East Asians just aren’t meant to enjoy life? I genuinely want work-life balance, but my inner workaholic always seems to take over. The most fair thing in life is that everyone gets 24 hours a day. Whenever you invest time and energy in one thing, you’re inevitably sacrificing another. Looking back at the “Life in Weeks” chart I drew in February—from birth to 2077 (my lifespan goal)—maybe now isn’t the time for balance just yet.</p> <p>Today I worked on integrating the map page. I’m currently tweaking the map’s appearance. The default tile layers are ugly and cluttered with too much irrelevant information. I need to simplify and adjust the color scheme. Once that’s done in the next couple of days, I’ll share an update. The goal is to make it silky smooth and visually clean.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 53%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you match any of the following, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>You can stick with it</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 6️⃣2️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 61/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-61-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 61/100days"/><published>2025-04-18T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-18T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-61-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-61-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day6️⃣1️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Map </div> <p>I’m about to start working on the map feature — one of the most crucial aspects of trip planning visualization. For people with a strong sense of direction, like myself, displaying various POIs directly on the map is the most effective way to plan. Personally, once I look at a map and consider my available time and preferences, I can immediately visualize the entire trip’s flow and rhythm.</p> <p>I especially enjoy saving interesting spots on Apple Maps or Google Maps. On the actual travel day, I decide what to visit based on the weather, mood, and time, making flexible decisions on the go. I see this as a nice balance between rigid planning and spontaneous travel. Since I have a good sense of direction and memory for places, I can mentally compute routes or even quickly adjust plans in case of unexpected situations.</p> <p>But I know not everyone shares this habit or ability. What I want to provide is a way to use technology to reduce the cognitive load for people who find this challenging. For example, my partner is the complete opposite — she can’t read maps at all and totally relies on me as her personal GPS. If I can build an app that works well for both of us, I believe it can meet the needs of most people out there.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter): 52%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you match any of the following, feel free to reach out and chat:</p> <ol> <li>You can stick with it</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day6️⃣1️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 60/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-60-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 60/100days"/><published>2025-04-17T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-60-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-60-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day6️⃣0️⃣</p> <p>Today I came across an interesting article called <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software">Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers</a>.

We’ve seen a shift from local applications to cloud-based ones, where data moves to the cloud and devices like phones and computers are just endpoints. Even brain-computer interfaces can be seen as another form of access. In the future, we might see a trend back toward local-first and non-generalized software, partly because of the rise of video coding and AI-assisted development. (Just today I open-sourced a service where over 95% of the work was done by AI—I only handled a few key parts and barely looked at the code.)</p> <p>This means in the future, anyone can build a product, and it doesn’t have to be general-purpose. It could be something made just for a specific event—a trip, a wedding, a one-time activity. It’s disposable, like a single-use item. A generation growing up with such low-cost output tools will naturally adapt to this mindset. The article also mentions that many future products will serve local communities first, which makes perfect sense. The world is not as perfect as the internet makes it seem—there are still huge wealth gaps, underdeveloped regions, and people living below the poverty line. In some ways, AI could help address part of these issues.</p> <p>At the moment, we’re in the industrial, high-modernism age of software, where these standardized, one-size-fits-all apps are made for us by people who don’t know much about us.</p> <p>General-purpose or specialized? Large-scale or small-and-beautiful? Basic needs or long-tail demand? No commercial value = worthless? This article, with just a few slides and brief captions, is really worth a read. Like me, you might find yourself inspired or experience a shift in perspective.</p> <p>It’s like this: for just $20 a month, you can now get a capable assistant who can handle the bulk of development for you. In a way, this is technological inclusion—even long-tail and non-commercial projects now have a chance to exist and matter in the world.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 59%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 51%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you match the following, let’s connect:</p> <ol> <li>You’re persistent</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day6️⃣0️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 59/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 59/100days"/><published>2025-04-16T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-16T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣9️⃣</p> <p>Finally wrapped this part up—smooth transitions are in place.

Besides building my own product, I’m also actively following the latest trends and what’s currently hot in the space. Lately, there’s no doubt MCP has been the breakout star. Even non-technical founders are FOMOing hard.</p> <p>That said, I personally don’t think MCP is particularly technically challenging — that’s one point. Another is that, for most companies, it currently doesn’t have direct commercial value. However, it does carry some auxiliary value. For cloud providers in particular, MCP could offer strategic value, especially in driving sales of other products like compute resources. While it’s still a toB business for now, no one wants to be left behind in the FOMO wave.</p> <p>I’m exploring directions where this could potentially generate real value. Even though I’m still full-steam ahead on building Iter-X, I don’t believe success comes from just one product or project. I believe continuous learning, hands-on practice, consistent output, and a cycle of accumulation and innovation will increase the chances of achieving success in the long run.</p> <p>If you’re interested in this space, let’s chat.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data Layer: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you check these boxes, let’s connect:</p> <ol> <li>You can persist.</li> <li>You have a dream.</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣8️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 57/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 57/100days"/><published>2025-04-14T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-14T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣7️⃣</p> <p>I’m still fine-tuning the details—haha—I want the experience to be smooth as silk. This DragNDrop feature isn’t done yet, and I just can’t leave it unfinished. I’m almost there, just need to perfect a few small details.</p> <p>Actually, I wanted to talk a bit about being an indie developer or a solopreneur. I think a lot of people nowadays have this idea of creating something interesting, or maybe earning a bit of income on the side. It’s a good thing. Let me share my thoughts from Day 0️⃣ until now—nearly two months in. I’ve collaborated with others in the past on projects that required long-term, intense commitment, though not every day required syncing up or summarizing progress. But this time, it feels different. It’s more like starting a business—working around the clock. While it’s not the same as the carefree approach of my younger days, it’s still quite close to that feeling.</p> <p>So, if you’re thinking about starting something, I’d say go for a 100-Day Build in Public challenge. Of course, it doesn’t have to be public—you could do it for yourself. But using a 100-day timeframe to test yourself can be really enlightening. It lets you measure your resilience, test your ideas, and help you understand whether this path—a path that’s more likely to fail than succeed—is truly right for you. There are some things that aren’t suitable for sharing in public spaces. I have a lot of important reflections that I think shouldn’t be discussed here, as the implications might not be appropriate. After 100 days, I may look for opportunities to talk more about the people, events, experiences, and thoughts from this journey.</p> <p>After pausing to reflect, it’s time to move forward. To the solitary travelers out there, I hope that, in the many journeys you take in this lifetime, there will always be something that drives you onward and inspires you to keep exploring the endless unknown.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Vision</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 56/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 56/100days"/><published>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣6️⃣</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder if striving for perfection and obsessing over details is actually a bad thing.
