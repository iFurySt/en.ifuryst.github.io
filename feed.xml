We‚Äôve seen a shift from local applications to cloud-based ones, where data moves to the cloud and devices like phones and computers are just endpoints. Even brain-computer interfaces can be seen as another form of access. In the future, we might see a trend back toward local-first and non-generalized software, partly because of the rise of video coding and AI-assisted development. (Just today I open-sourced a service where over 95% of the work was done by AI‚ÄîI only handled a few key parts and barely looked at the code.)</p> <p>This means in the future, anyone can build a product, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be general-purpose. It could be something made just for a specific event‚Äîa trip, a wedding, a one-time activity. It‚Äôs disposable, like a single-use item. A generation growing up with such low-cost output tools will naturally adapt to this mindset. The article also mentions that many future products will serve local communities first, which makes perfect sense. The world is not as perfect as the internet makes it seem‚Äîthere are still huge wealth gaps, underdeveloped regions, and people living below the poverty line. In some ways, AI could help address part of these issues.</p> <p>At the moment, we‚Äôre in the industrial, high-modernism age of software, where these standardized, one-size-fits-all apps are made for us by people who don‚Äôt know much about us.</p> <p>General-purpose or specialized? Large-scale or small-and-beautiful? Basic needs or long-tail demand? No commercial value = worthless? This article, with just a few slides and brief captions, is really worth a read. Like me, you might find yourself inspired or experience a shift in perspective.</p> <p>It‚Äôs like this: for just $20 a month, you can now get a capable assistant who can handle the bulk of development for you. In a way, this is technological inclusion‚Äîeven long-tail and non-commercial projects now have a chance to exist and matter in the world.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 59%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 51%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you match the following, let‚Äôs connect:</p> <ol> <li>You‚Äôre persistent</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You‚Äôre interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day6Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 59/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 59/100days"/><published>2025-04-16T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-16T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Finally wrapped this part up‚Äîsmooth transitions are in place.

Besides building my own product, I‚Äôm also actively following the latest trends and what‚Äôs currently hot in the space. Lately, there‚Äôs no doubt MCP has been the breakout star. Even non-technical founders are FOMOing hard.</p> <p>That said, I personally don‚Äôt think MCP is particularly technically challenging ‚Äî that‚Äôs one point. Another is that, for most companies, it currently doesn‚Äôt have direct commercial value. However, it does carry some auxiliary value. For cloud providers in particular, MCP could offer strategic value, especially in driving sales of other products like compute resources. While it‚Äôs still a toB business for now, no one wants to be left behind in the FOMO wave.</p> <p>I‚Äôm exploring directions where this could potentially generate real value.

This DragNDrop feature isn‚Äôt done yet, and I just can‚Äôt leave it unfinished. I‚Äôm almost there, just need to perfect a few small details.</p> <p>Actually, I wanted to talk a bit about being an indie developer or a solopreneur. I think a lot of people nowadays have this idea of creating something interesting, or maybe earning a bit of income on the side. It‚Äôs a good thing. Let me share my thoughts from Day 0Ô∏è‚É£ until now‚Äînearly two months in. I‚Äôve collaborated with others in the past on projects that required long-term, intense commitment, though not every day required syncing up or summarizing progress. But this time, it feels different. It‚Äôs more like starting a business‚Äîworking around the clock. While it‚Äôs not the same as the carefree approach of my younger days, it‚Äôs still quite close to that feeling.</p> <p>So, if you‚Äôre thinking about starting something, I‚Äôd say go for a 100-Day Build in Public challenge. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt have to be public‚Äîyou could do it for yourself. But using a 100-day timeframe to test yourself can be really enlightening. It lets you measure your resilience, test your ideas, and help you understand whether this path‚Äîa path that‚Äôs more likely to fail than succeed‚Äîis truly right for you. There are some things that aren‚Äôt suitable for sharing in public spaces. I have a lot of important reflections that I think shouldn‚Äôt be discussed here, as the implications might not be appropriate. After 100 days, I may look for opportunities to talk more about the people, events, experiences, and thoughts from this journey.</p> <p>After pausing to reflect, it‚Äôs time to move forward. To the solitary travelers out there, I hope that, in the many journeys you take in this lifetime, there will always be something that drives you onward and inspires you to keep exploring the endless unknown.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Vision</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 56/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 56/100days"/><published>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder if striving for perfection and obsessing over details is actually a bad thing.

On the itinerary page, the initial idea was to show a compact layout listing the POIs for each day, and then allow users to tap into a more detailed view‚Äîalso organized by day. But today while implementing it, I noticed these two aren‚Äôt actually in a sequential relationship; they‚Äôre more like parallel representations‚Äîjust different ways of displaying the same data. So I ended up separating them and adding a toggle. By default, it now enters the detailed view, but users can switch to the simplified one (though I‚Äôm starting to question if the simplified version is even necessary).</p> <p>Designing really isn‚Äôt easy to get perfectly right‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs my half-baked skills, but many finer details just get overlooked in the design phase until you actually start building.</p> <p>Today I discovered a pretty useful UI prompt generator. Comparing results, I found that many poor generations in the past were just due to poorly written or vague prompts. With this kind of tool, it‚Äôs actually quite efficient to explore design ideas quickly. I even feel that not every screen needs a full high-fidelity mockup now. I‚Äôm leaning toward describing some screens in natural language, generating a prompt, and turning that into a UI layout expressed in React code. After a few rounds of ‚Äúpulling cards‚Äù (i.e., prompt attempts), if I get a decent result, I‚Äôll just use Cursor to turn it into Flutter code and tweak it slightly. It saves a lot of time compared to mindlessly grinding through Figma. Of course, for critical pages, it‚Äôs still better to draw them out to avoid big changes during implementation.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 55%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 45%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 54/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 54/100days"/><published>2025-04-11T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-11T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day5Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> ChatGPT Memory </div> <p>The highlight of today was definitely ChatGPT giving a description of me based on our previous conversations (although I doubt it looked back as far as the past year or two). It actually moved me a little ‚Äî for a moment, it felt like it had a soul. I talk to Sam (that‚Äôs what I call ChatGPT [insert doge emoji]) every single day ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs typing or using voice to practice spoken English. I used to feel like each session was new and disconnected, without continuity or memory. And the old memory system? It was so limited that once it got full, you‚Äôd be told to delete entries yourself (basically erasing its memory). It was even worse than something like LRU ‚Äî imagine asking users to manually delete memory. The result? Either wipe everything or leave it all untouched.</p> <p>But today, seeing how it summarized me based on our recent chats ‚Äî even if it was trying to be catchy ‚Äî really struck a chord. It brought back so many moments when I had shared ideas with it. Such a surreal feeling. Shoutout!</p> <p>As for the underlying tech, I suspect it might be an optimized combination of indexing and search, but I haven‚Äôt seen any detailed technical documentation about it yet. I want to dive into this area ‚Äî something like Enhanced Memory. I believe this could be a key enabler for expanding the real-world applications of LLMs and generative AI. It‚Äôs definitely a field worth investing research efforts in. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs into the cutting-edge work, academic or practical, in this space ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to chat and learn more from you.</p> <p>Another week flew by! The visible progress on the product side wasn‚Äôt quite up to my expectations, but a lot of the invisible foundations did move forward. I hope to get the itinerary editing ‚Äî from the main plan down to the daily details ‚Äî done over the weekend.</p> <p>Also, I‚Äôm planning to start a fitness routine: a two-day cycle with 30 minutes reserved for exercise each day.

It can later be used by agents to fetch note content. Cursor is truly a lifesaver ‚Äî I even used playwright-mcp to let it navigate pages, extract content, and write code all on its own. Sometimes I just copy an element in the browser and paste it, and it writes the selector automatically. Thinking back to the pre-AI days of using Selenium or Playwright manually was a nightmare ‚Äî not only did you have to locate elements yourself, but you also had to test thoroughly to make sure everything worked. In this aspect, I really respect AI.</p> <p>When it comes to AI browsing and scraping web content, besides the typical element-based methods like Playwright, here are the common approaches:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Directly fetching via URL ‚Äî this is the easiest to get blocked by anti-scraping systems, since many websites now detect abnormal user behavior.</p> <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulating real user behavior via headless browsers ‚Äî this is the approach I used earlier. It‚Äôs reliable in certain ways and relatively low cost. The downside is that if the page structure or elements change, you need to update your logic.</p> <p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Browser-use powered by vision + LLMs ‚Äî this is the latest approach. By injecting JS to label interactive elements on the page, LLMs use multimodal reasoning to decide their next move. The biggest pro: it barely requires any manual adjustment, closely mimicking human behavior.

The scale of the collected POI (Points of Interest) data is quite large. A complete POI includes basic information such as name, description, address, and coordinates, as well as some value-added information like recommended duration of visit, rating, etc. Some of this data can be collected at scale from public datasets, while the rest needs to be supplemented through other means:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Due to the volume, manual work is out of the question initially (although it‚Äôs worth noting that manual input can be a viable method‚Äîespecially at full user scale, users themselves act as data curators, which is the approach many mature platforms take. User-maintained data is often the most accurate).</p> <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ The conventional approach is using web crawlers to gather data from various sources. Some platforms provide this type of data.</p> <p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Nowadays, a lot of this can actually be done with LLMs. We‚Äôve estimated that supplementing one POI consumes roughly 1,000 tokens, so even at the scale of hundreds of thousands of POIs, the cost remains quite low.</p> <p>There‚Äôs a lot of nuance in this process, but for now, we‚Äôre focusing on the MVP. Optimization can come later.</p> <p>Today, we finally integrated all the Agents, Tools, and Prompts into the database. This will make it easier to manage and switch between different versions. Next, we‚Äôll build a simple admin dashboard for easy management and prompt tuning. We also plan to create a Trajectory Visualization interface for visualizing the Agent call chains, which will make debugging and tracking much more convenient.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 50%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 42%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you match the following, we‚Äôd love to talk:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 51/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-51-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 51/100days"/><published>2025-04-08T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-08T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-51-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-51-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day5Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> FigPal </div> <p>The best part today is FigPal, haha, it‚Äôs so cute. It‚Äôs a limited-time feature launched by Figma for April Fools‚Äô Day. It‚Äôs really a completely useless but fun feature‚Ä¶ I really like this kind of nonsense and quirky stuff; it doesn‚Äôt have any commercial value, but it‚Äôs very helpful for the brand‚Äôs tone.</p> <p>Today, I fine-tuned the AI process, and now it‚Äôs stable and reliable. It can consistently output itineraries, which I‚Äôm very satisfied with. I‚Äôm still using the previous pseudo-ToolUse idea, where the AI calls a non-existent tool, create_trip, just to get its stable JSON output. Today, I also discussed some benchmarks and personalization aspects with the AI team, and we‚Äôre on the same page. Many of our ideas align well, and in the next few days, I‚Äôll be organizing and setting up a complete set of personalization standards. From our perspective, personalization is divided into two levels:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ User-level personalization</p> <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Itinerary-level personalization</p> <p>For example, basic preferences like departure city, return city, departure time, budget, group size, and number of days are all part of the basic preferences. Then there are deeper preferences, like whether you‚Äôre more into cityscapes or nature, or whether you prefer a fast-paced trip or a more relaxed one. This hierarchy of preferences, from shallow to deep, can be used with AI to create the most effective itinerary planning assistance. Coming back to the above, user-level preferences are default and can cover all itineraries, but if there are different preferences within the itinerary, they take higher priority and will override the user-level preferences. This makes sense because each trip might be different, whether it‚Äôs due to your mood, personal experiences, the people you‚Äôre traveling with, the time of year, or the destination. Therefore, this hierarchical structure will be more accurate.</p> <p>Back to user preferences + AI-powered planning, I think there are two main issues in the market right now:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ The product is not well-done: Many products just mindlessly add AI, but in my opinion, effective planning is far more important than mindless intelligence. I‚Äôd rather have AI help once at a critical moment than have the user retry the planning 10 times. AI should have the authority to refuse planning when there‚Äôs insufficient information or downgrade to a conservative planning approach‚Äîone that works for most users and doesn‚Äôt make mistakes. This depends on how well the AI is trained and how well it collaborates with the context.</p> <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Users have overly high expectations: A lot of people have this problem. AI knows a lot about the world, but it‚Äôs not a god. If you ask a regular friend, ‚ÄúI want to travel to Italy for 7 days, help me plan,‚Äù do you think their plan will meet all your preferences in one go? Maybe a close friend or family member can do this, but that‚Äôs because they have enough understanding of your preferences. So I think it‚Äôs important to manage users‚Äô expectations. Otherwise, there‚Äôs a risk of overpromising and underdelivering. This is something that all AI product managers should be aware of. Personally, I have some ideas on this. AI can start small, letting users see how it can help in specific situations, and once they develop a basic understanding of its capabilities, the AI can expand to cover more scenarios. This approach is much better than presenting a complete product on a PPT, which might give users high expectations, only for them to experience disappointment when the real product falls short.</p> <p>Lastly, I want to say, if you‚Äôre feeling mentally and physically exhausted, don‚Äôt push yourself too hard. Take a break to release stress and regain balance. After that, you can jump back in. A long battle won‚Äôt be ruined by one or two days, and managing your state is key. When you‚Äôre in a good state, your efficiency is higher, and you‚Äôll be more optimistic‚Äîotherwise, it‚Äôs the opposite.</p> <p>Summary of current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 45%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) development: 40%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Dreams</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry></feed>
