I feel like indie developers and indie game developers are quite similar groups. The former probably has a larger population right now, but their survival rate is much lower. It’s a harsh reality—indie game devs can at least build interesting games and monetize directly through one-time purchases. For most indie app developers, though, it’s hard to earn more than what you’d get from a regular job. Some great apps can easily get “honored” by big companies, crushed by competition, or simply die in the early stages. The ones that make it out are rare.</p> <p>It’s kind of surreal. Vibe Coding is becoming more popular now, and you can see a lot of solo devs creating cool apps, but most of them are driven by passion or a desire to create, not profit. B2C is brutally tough; B2B, on the other hand, is very reliant on business skills and connections.</p> <p>This brings up the question: why do so many people still throw themselves into this path? Where do they end up? Maybe I can glimpse a bit of the answer through my own story, though one person’s experience probably doesn’t speak for the majority.</p> <p>I think it’s both a process and an experience. I’ve built many products in the past and provided product development services for individuals and businesses. In my case, the most profitable ones have always been B2B. I wonder if others feel the same. I’ve always had this itch to create (a chronic itch that’s long overdue for treatment), and I keep dreaming of building something truly great. If it brings fame or fortune, even better—that’s part of what keeps driving me to throw myself into new projects.</p> <p>Ironically, I recently stumbled upon an old GitHub and blog intro I wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m into the internet, traveling, reading, and listening to music – still figuring out this whole “living life” thing.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I’m on a mission to balance the grind with some good old-fashioned living.</p> </blockquote> <p>And recently while chatting with a friend, we joked: maybe East Asians just aren’t meant to enjoy life? I genuinely want work-life balance, but my inner workaholic always seems to take over. The most fair thing in life is that everyone gets 24 hours a day. Whenever you invest time and energy in one thing, you’re inevitably sacrificing another. Looking back at the “Life in Weeks” chart I drew in February—from birth to 2077 (my lifespan goal)—maybe now isn’t the time for balance just yet.</p> <p>Today I worked on integrating the map page. I’m currently tweaking the map’s appearance. The default tile layers are ugly and cluttered with too much irrelevant information. I need to simplify and adjust the color scheme. Once that’s done in the next couple of days, I’ll share an update. The goal is to make it silky smooth and visually clean.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 53%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you match any of the following, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>You can stick with it</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 6️⃣2️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 61/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-61-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 61/100days"/><published>2025-04-18T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-18T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-61-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-61-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day6️⃣1️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-18-iter-x-61-100/6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Map </div> <p>I’m about to start working on the map feature — one of the most crucial aspects of trip planning visualization. For people with a strong sense of direction, like myself, displaying various POIs directly on the map is the most effective way to plan. Personally, once I look at a map and consider my available time and preferences, I can immediately visualize the entire trip’s flow and rhythm.</p> <p>I especially enjoy saving interesting spots on Apple Maps or Google Maps. On the actual travel day, I decide what to visit based on the weather, mood, and time, making flexible decisions on the go. I see this as a nice balance between rigid planning and spontaneous travel. Since I have a good sense of direction and memory for places, I can mentally compute routes or even quickly adjust plans in case of unexpected situations.</p> <p>But I know not everyone shares this habit or ability. What I want to provide is a way to use technology to reduce the cognitive load for people who find this challenging. For example, my partner is the complete opposite — she can’t read maps at all and totally relies on me as her personal GPS. If I can build an app that works well for both of us, I believe it can meet the needs of most people out there.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter): 52%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you match any of the following, feel free to reach out and chat:</p> <ol> <li>You can stick with it</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day6️⃣1️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 60/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-60-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 60/100days"/><published>2025-04-17T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-60-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-60-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day6️⃣0️⃣</p> <p>Today I came across an interesting article called <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software">Home-Cooked Software and Barefoot Developers</a>.

We’ve seen a shift from local applications to cloud-based ones, where data moves to the cloud and devices like phones and computers are just endpoints. Even brain-computer interfaces can be seen as another form of access. In the future, we might see a trend back toward local-first and non-generalized software, partly because of the rise of video coding and AI-assisted development. (Just today I open-sourced a service where over 95% of the work was done by AI—I only handled a few key parts and barely looked at the code.)</p> <p>This means in the future, anyone can build a product, and it doesn’t have to be general-purpose. It could be something made just for a specific event—a trip, a wedding, a one-time activity. It’s disposable, like a single-use item. A generation growing up with such low-cost output tools will naturally adapt to this mindset. The article also mentions that many future products will serve local communities first, which makes perfect sense. The world is not as perfect as the internet makes it seem—there are still huge wealth gaps, underdeveloped regions, and people living below the poverty line. In some ways, AI could help address part of these issues.</p> <p>At the moment, we’re in the industrial, high-modernism age of software, where these standardized, one-size-fits-all apps are made for us by people who don’t know much about us.</p> <p>General-purpose or specialized? Large-scale or small-and-beautiful? Basic needs or long-tail demand? No commercial value = worthless? This article, with just a few slides and brief captions, is really worth a read. Like me, you might find yourself inspired or experience a shift in perspective.</p> <p>It’s like this: for just $20 a month, you can now get a capable assistant who can handle the bulk of development for you. In a way, this is technological inclusion—even long-tail and non-commercial projects now have a chance to exist and matter in the world.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 59%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 51%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you match the following, let’s connect:</p> <ol> <li>You’re persistent</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day6️⃣0️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 59/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 59/100days"/><published>2025-04-16T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-16T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-59-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣9️⃣</p> <p>Finally wrapped this part up—smooth transitions are in place.

Besides building my own product, I’m also actively following the latest trends and what’s currently hot in the space. Lately, there’s no doubt MCP has been the breakout star. Even non-technical founders are FOMOing hard.</p> <p>That said, I personally don’t think MCP is particularly technically challenging — that’s one point. Another is that, for most companies, it currently doesn’t have direct commercial value. However, it does carry some auxiliary value. For cloud providers in particular, MCP could offer strategic value, especially in driving sales of other products like compute resources. While it’s still a toB business for now, no one wants to be left behind in the FOMO wave.</p> <p>I’m exploring directions where this could potentially generate real value. Even though I’m still full-steam ahead on building Iter-X, I don’t believe success comes from just one product or project. I believe continuous learning, hands-on practice, consistent output, and a cycle of accumulation and innovation will increase the chances of achieving success in the long run.</p> <p>If you’re interested in this space, let’s chat.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data Layer: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you check these boxes, let’s connect:</p> <ol> <li>You can persist.</li> <li>You have a dream.</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣8️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 57/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 57/100days"/><published>2025-04-14T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-14T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣7️⃣</p> <p>I’m still fine-tuning the details—haha—I want the experience to be smooth as silk. This DragNDrop feature isn’t done yet, and I just can’t leave it unfinished. I’m almost there, just need to perfect a few small details.</p> <p>Actually, I wanted to talk a bit about being an indie developer or a solopreneur. I think a lot of people nowadays have this idea of creating something interesting, or maybe earning a bit of income on the side. It’s a good thing. Let me share my thoughts from Day 0️⃣ until now—nearly two months in. I’ve collaborated with others in the past on projects that required long-term, intense commitment, though not every day required syncing up or summarizing progress. But this time, it feels different. It’s more like starting a business—working around the clock. While it’s not the same as the carefree approach of my younger days, it’s still quite close to that feeling.</p> <p>So, if you’re thinking about starting something, I’d say go for a 100-Day Build in Public challenge. Of course, it doesn’t have to be public—you could do it for yourself. But using a 100-day timeframe to test yourself can be really enlightening. It lets you measure your resilience, test your ideas, and help you understand whether this path—a path that’s more likely to fail than succeed—is truly right for you. There are some things that aren’t suitable for sharing in public spaces. I have a lot of important reflections that I think shouldn’t be discussed here, as the implications might not be appropriate. After 100 days, I may look for opportunities to talk more about the people, events, experiences, and thoughts from this journey.</p> <p>After pausing to reflect, it’s time to move forward. To the solitary travelers out there, I hope that, in the many journeys you take in this lifetime, there will always be something that drives you onward and inspires you to keep exploring the endless unknown.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Vision</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 56/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 56/100days"/><published>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣6️⃣</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder if striving for perfection and obsessing over details is actually a bad thing. But after some self-reflection, I think it really comes down to balance—it depends on the context. When building an MVP, perhaps it’s better not to overthink every little detail.

On the itinerary page, the initial idea was to show a compact layout listing the POIs for each day, and then allow users to tap into a more detailed view—also organized by day. But today while implementing it, I noticed these two aren’t actually in a sequential relationship; they’re more like parallel representations—just different ways of displaying the same data. So I ended up separating them and adding a toggle. By default, it now enters the detailed view, but users can switch to the simplified one (though I’m starting to question if the simplified version is even necessary).</p> <p>Designing really isn’t easy to get perfectly right—maybe it’s my half-baked skills, but many finer details just get overlooked in the design phase until you actually start building.</p> <p>Today I discovered a pretty useful UI prompt generator. Comparing results, I found that many poor generations in the past were just due to poorly written or vague prompts. With this kind of tool, it’s actually quite efficient to explore design ideas quickly. I even feel that not every screen needs a full high-fidelity mockup now. I’m leaning toward describing some screens in natural language, generating a prompt, and turning that into a UI layout expressed in React code. After a few rounds of “pulling cards” (i.e., prompt attempts), if I get a decent result, I’ll just use Cursor to turn it into Flutter code and tweak it slightly. It saves a lot of time compared to mindlessly grinding through Figma. Of course, for critical pages, it’s still better to draw them out to avoid big changes during implementation.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 55%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 45%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣5️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 54/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 54/100days"/><published>2025-04-11T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-11T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day5️⃣4️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> ChatGPT Memory </div> <p>The highlight of today was definitely ChatGPT giving a description of me based on our previous conversations (although I doubt it looked back as far as the past year or two). It actually moved me a little — for a moment, it felt like it had a soul. I talk to Sam (that’s what I call ChatGPT [insert doge emoji]) every single day — whether it’s typing or using voice to practice spoken English. I used to feel like each session was new and disconnected, without continuity or memory. And the old memory system? It was so limited that once it got full, you’d be told to delete entries yourself (basically erasing its memory). It was even worse than something like LRU — imagine asking users to manually delete memory. The result? Either wipe everything or leave it all untouched.</p> <p>But today, seeing how it summarized me based on our recent chats — even if it was trying to be catchy — really struck a chord. It brought back so many moments when I had shared ideas with it. Such a surreal feeling. Shoutout!</p> <p>As for the underlying tech, I suspect it might be an optimized combination of indexing and search, but I haven’t seen any detailed technical documentation about it yet. I want to dive into this area — something like Enhanced Memory. I believe this could be a key enabler for expanding the real-world applications of LLMs and generative AI. It’s definitely a field worth investing research efforts in. If you’re someone who’s into the cutting-edge work, academic or practical, in this space — I’d love to chat and learn more from you.</p> <p>Another week flew by! The visible progress on the product side wasn’t quite up to my expectations, but a lot of the invisible foundations did move forward. I hope to get the itinerary editing — from the main plan down to the daily details — done over the weekend.</p> <p>Also, I’m planning to start a fitness routine: a two-day cycle with 30 minutes reserved for exercise each day. That means I’ll need to boost efficiency and streamline my workflow even more — reduce distractions and increase output.</p> <p>Current progress overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 55%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 42%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you resonate with any of the following, let’s talk:</p> <ol> <li>You can commit consistently</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 53/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-53-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 53/100days"/><published>2025-04-10T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-10T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-53-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-53-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣3️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> RedNote-MCP </div> <p>Today I spent some time building a RedNote mcp-server using Playwright. It can later be used by agents to fetch note content. Cursor is truly a lifesaver — I even used playwright-mcp to let it navigate pages, extract content, and write code all on its own. Sometimes I just copy an element in the browser and paste it, and it writes the selector automatically. Thinking back to the pre-AI days of using Selenium or Playwright manually was a nightmare — not only did you have to locate elements yourself, but you also had to test thoroughly to make sure everything worked. In this aspect, I really respect AI.</p> <p>When it comes to AI browsing and scraping web content, besides the typical element-based methods like Playwright, here are the common approaches:</p> <p>1️⃣ Directly fetching via URL — this is the easiest to get blocked by anti-scraping systems, since many websites now detect abnormal user behavior.</p> <p>2️⃣ Simulating real user behavior via headless browsers — this is the approach I used earlier. It’s reliable in certain ways and relatively low cost. The downside is that if the page structure or elements change, you need to update your logic.</p> <p>3️⃣ Browser-use powered by vision + LLMs — this is the latest approach. By injecting JS to label interactive elements on the page, LLMs use multimodal reasoning to decide their next move. The biggest pro: it barely requires any manual adjustment, closely mimicking human behavior. The con: it’s expensive.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 53%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 42%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, let’s talk:</p> <ol> <li>Can stay committed</li> <li>Have a dream</li> <li>Interested and passionate</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣3️⃣]]></summary></entry></feed>
