I applied for access to their open platform, and they rejected me 5 or 6 times. It’s so ridiculous. We’re still in the design and development stage, without any trademarks or software copyrights, and they just won’t approve it. It’s infuriating. Their response was something like, “It might involve using others’ app flow diagrams for submission.” So how should I prove that this is something we’ve designed ourselves? It’s really irritating.</p> <p>The past couple of days, I’ve been talking more with team members about the product and preparing for the meetup.

The entire evening was spent connecting with others. This weekend, we plan to hold the first online meetup for the core team, with a casual and relaxed tone. There will be roughly three parts: first, a chance for everyone to get to know each other; second, sharing backgrounds, initial intentions, and recent insights from discussions with various online communities; third, a casual chat about the future pace, collaboration, and overall direction of the product.</p> <p>Today, I came across a quote from Poor Charlie’s Almanack from June 2021:</p> <p>“The species that survive are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the ones most adaptable to change.”</p> <p>I hope that in the AI era, we can all adapt to this new age. The tangible changes are already upon us and will continue to come, just like the saying in Alice in Wonderland, “We’re all just running to stay in the same place.” 🫡</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 16%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 15%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 3%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following conditions, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Have a dream</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 16/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 16/100days"/><published>2025-03-04T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-04T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day1️⃣6️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Coming Soon </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Coming Soon </div> <p>To keep it short, the registration has been approved.

When jumping straight into coding, you can work with vague ideas, but if you need to make adjustments during the implementation, the cost becomes quite high. On the other hand, dragging and dropping elements in Figma requires much less effort, and sometimes you can experiment and expand your thoughts.</p> <p>Although I’ve worked on many projects before, this time I’ve taken a more serious approach to design, controlling the details and thinking about interactions from scratch. I can’t help but feel that even the simplest MVP requires a lot of effort, and I have great respect for solo founders. Recently, I’ve noticed a phenomenon on several platforms—many people are very FOMO (especially during the period when I was inspired by DeepSeek). They’re anxious, scared that they’ll fall behind after just a day or two and miss the opportunity to make money. However, some things just can’t be rushed. Although the startup market is all about racing against time, fearing that a second could mean losing the market, I still lean toward a long-term approach. Technology moves in waves, and you never know which wave will be the biggest or the one that helps you stand up. What you can do is keep sharpening yourself on the sea. You only need to catch a wave or two and manage to stand up—then it’s enough. Always remember, the tide will eventually go out, and how many will be left with their pants down?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Creation Page Design </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Creation Page Design </div> <p>Today, I turned an idea for a city selection page into reality, and it feels great. I love the feeling of creation, like coding or painting—creating something from nothing. I enjoy it! I had originally planned to outsource the design, but since I shifted my focus to academics and exam prep, I had to take this responsibility on myself. I think it’s a blessing in disguise, as it allows me to fully bring my ideas to life. Though at times I’ve struggled with my aesthetics and design skills, I still strive to learn from excellent and eye-catching designs. I also often talk with designers I know to get feedback on my ideas and ask for help. However, I’ve realized that design is really subjective; each designer’s style is unique. So, I often don’t agree with some design ideas, and it leads to lots of back-and-forth discussions and revisions. But it’s also great—sometimes we exchange ideas, try things out, and new results come out of it. I’d love to have the chance in the future to make some merchandise for this app to give to users and key creators 🤡</p> <p>Here’s an update on the current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 15%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 14%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 3%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Has an interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 13/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-13-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 13/100days"/><published>2025-03-01T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-01T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-13-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-13-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day1️⃣3️⃣</p> <p>Today, I took half a day off and felt much better mentally.

One of them was:</p> <p>“One further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!”</p> <p>In essence, he does not consider a candidate’s school background when choosing a CEO. Despite having studied at three prestigious schools himself, he firmly believes in lifelong learning. Many business geniuses don’t need academic credentials to prove themselves. The business world naturally fosters talented people through experience.</p> <p>I’m also a strong advocate for lifelong learning. I always believe that broad learning can unlock infinite potential. Modern society has categorized various disciplines, transforming people into specialists, which makes sense for maximizing social efficiency as complexity increases. (However, the social optimum doesn’t always equal the individual optimum.)</p> <p>This easily traps most people into a preconceived notion, creating barriers that are so ingrained that we never question them. I remember Da Vinci as a polymath who excelled across several fields. I think in this AI-powered era, the potential to accumulate and learn information is far beyond what the internet era could offer. If you want to learn, you can access nearly all of humanity’s knowledge— the only barrier to learning is within yourself. The obsession with degrees is merely a way for employers to reduce hiring costs in the job market. It’s not the only standard and certainly not an objective one. Don’t let degrees or academic fields blind you— your boundaries may go far beyond that.</p> <p>Recently, several people have asked if they can join, and as I mentioned in my previous co-creation initiative, it’s not about whether you can join. If you’re willing to try, you’re welcome. We maintain an open mindset to welcome everyone and also respect those who choose to leave silently.</p> <p>A new member who can draw has joined today and will help with some of the design tasks 🎉</p> <p>Today, I further refined the details of the daily itinerary page and began adding the location pages.

Time flies. The biggest challenge for me today is the Revenue Model. Our product is destined to be a free product, so we need to think about how to survive during the early stages of development, as there will be no revenue for the time being. I’m also starting to look into angel investments, although we haven’t hit MVP or PMF yet, I think it’s reasonable to start thinking and preparing now. Once I finish the prototype and UI design, I’ll also begin working on the BP, as it will help organize my thoughts and clarify any chaotic or unclear ideas.</p> <p>Today, we have a new team member who specializes in data and AI 😎. Now our team has more than one person working on each major direction, which helps with collaboration and discussions. However, I’m still hoping to find someone who can draw or create personalized stickers. If you’re out there, come hit me up (no need to be a professional artist—AI-generated images that you then modify are also totally fine!).</p> <p>Today, I completed part of the daily itinerary design, and I’m actually quite satisfied with this version. I’m not from a design background, so I’m a bit of a self-taught designer, but I’ve learned some valuable lessons. One thing I’ve found is that in design, it’s common to end up scrapping everything you’ve previously done and starting over. I think this is a fairly frequent occurrence because you need to consider the prototype, UI, and UX all at once. In this situation, many ideas remain vague and chaotic, so it’s not always possible to settle on the final version right from the start. This process requires exploration and experimentation. I think that’s why I admire creators so much, including artists. It’s difficult to create something from nothing, but modifying something that already exists is much easier. So, I think this is normal. If you’re pursuing excellence, you need to focus on user experience, operational smoothness, and convenience, while also paying attention to aesthetics—making sure the design stands out and gives users that “wow” feeling. On top of that, you need to consider the implementation cost because many designs look great but are costly to implement.</p> <p>Summary of the current status:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 10%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 11%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 3%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you fit the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have big dreams</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣0️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 9/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-9-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 9/100days"/><published>2025-02-25T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-9-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-9-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day9️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Itinerary Page Design </div> <p>Today, things are finally starting to move.

Currently working hard to optimize it. Here’s a half-finished version, but it’s still in need of some fine-tuning to stand out. It needs to be not only functional but also visually appealing, and I still need to think about the best way to present it 😭</p> <p>Summary of the current status:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 8%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 10%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 3%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you fit the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have big dreams</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day9️⃣]]></summary></entry></feed>
