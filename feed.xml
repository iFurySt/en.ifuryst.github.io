I‚Äôm planning to use Function Call‚Äôs JSON return to achieve a stable structured JSON output. Essentially, I‚Äôm tricking the AI by using a tool that doesn‚Äôt actually exist or need execution. Normally, we rely on prompts to request a JSON response, but that approach doesn‚Äôt seem to guarantee 100% stability.</p> <p>I‚Äôve also further broken down the agents into more atomic units. Now, each agent handles a very specific task, making it easier to reuse their functions. For example, I‚Äôve separated CityPlanner and TripPlanner, so if the destination city is unknown, AI can first plan the cities before diving into the itinerary. Over the next couple of days, I‚Äôll focus on connecting the entire itinerary module, which will bring the core functionality to life.</p> <p>It‚Äôs hard to believe that nearly half of the 100-day journey has passed. The intensity of daily output is quite demanding, especially since some days don‚Äôt show obvious progress. The public is mostly visual-oriented, and I don‚Äôt want to dig into too many technical details because that would be even more tedious. Instead, I mix in insights and news occasionally. If I build in public again in the future, I might consider sharing in phases rather than posting daily updates. I don‚Äôt want the content to become a monotonous log‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather deliver it when there‚Äôs something valuable to share.</p> <p>Current Progress: ‚Ä¢ Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33% ‚Ä¢ Backend (Go) Development: 36% ‚Ä¢ Client (Flutter) Development: 25% ‚Ä¢ Data: 10%</p> <p>If you meet the following criteria, let‚Äôs connect:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Ambitious</li> <li>Passionate</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 45/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-45-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 45/100days"/><published>2025-04-02T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-02T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-45-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-45-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Main Trip Page &amp; Mine Page </div> <p>Still working on the pages. I plan to integrate the itinerary this week and check if I‚Äôm going anywhere for the Qingming Festival. If not, I should be able to finish it. The progress has been good these past two days. I will reassess the overall progress next week. These tasks are being pushed forward based on my intuition, not following a strict timeline, which I think is one of the challenges in project management. If there was a clear roadmap and the requirements were well-defined, progress could be more predictable and manageable. Otherwise, it‚Äôs difficult to smoothly advance the project. Right now, we‚Äôre still in a chaotic state, and everything is growing wildly, which is a significant issue. However, we could consider introducing a simple visual dashboard to track our MVP progress. But because the collaboration is quite loose, it‚Äôs challenging to bring in project management tools commonly used in the industry. This is a bit of a paradox, and I‚Äôll need to think about and learn more about it. The goal is not to add unnecessary complexity, but to make sure everyone on the team clearly understands the current project status‚Äîwhere the bottlenecks are, where they stand, and what others are working on. These insights would be meaningful.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the current summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 34%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter) progress: 23%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI designer üëæ):</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dreamer</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 44/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-44-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 44/100days"/><published>2025-04-01T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-44-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-44-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> POI </div> <p>Today, we made significant progress with our POI data.

There are some tasks I can automate using n8n, which will help improve my efficiency and productivity. I think investing time in this is worthwhile. For example, I can quickly push articles I‚Äôve written to different platforms through some custom nodes and workflows. Another thing is information aggregation and dimensionality reduction. I‚Äôve been consuming a lot of information daily, and I need to aggregate it to reduce redundant news. This way, I can allocate more time to reading in-depth articles. Having a broad yet precise strategy allows me to stay on top of the latest trends while also exploring interesting ideas.

They expect to generate $200 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) through subscriptions over the next 12 months. They‚Äôre currently raising a new round of funding, and their valuation is expected to reach $10 billion. This company currently has only 50 employees, which is impressive. Their success is largely due to early popularity within developer circles and winning Product Hunt‚Äôs 2024 Product of the Year award. Since then, they‚Äôve continued to gain popularity. Their net revenue retention rate (NRR) for March 2024 reached an astounding 250%. What does this mean? It indicates that their existing customers are not only continuing to pay but are also paying more‚Äî$1 per customer is now $2.50. A typical NRR of 115% is already considered excellent, as it signifies steady revenue growth from existing customers. So, Cursor‚Äôs NRR is truly remarkable. Personally, I‚Äôm not surprised at all. I think Cursor has surpassed traditional IDEs and has become the new standard. JetBrains products seem to have stagnated. Recently, I‚Äôve been using it extensively for creating SOP manuals and training documents for my team to refer to before starting new tasks. The results have been incredible. One of my team members, whom I introduced to it, couldn‚Äôt stop praising it and spent the entire day watching AI-related content. I‚Äôll share more on this topic later. If you‚Äôre still in the camp of not using it or criticizing it as hard to use, I urge you to reconsider. I believe you‚Äôll soon realize that others are moving ahead, and if you think it‚Äôs hard to use, try to see if you‚Äôre using it incorrectly or misjudging the AI‚Äôs capabilities, leading to incorrect results.

This is understandable; at the beginning, there are a lot of things to handle. After completing a few pages or APIs, many things can be reused, so the speed naturally picks up.</p> <p>Today, I was looking into Bluesky‚Äôs ATProtocol. Although I had seen it before, I hadn‚Äôt carefully examined its technical architecture. After reading an article analyzing it, I started thinking about whether a decentralized blockchain social platform could become the next big trend. After all, the Web3 buzz has been going on for quite a while. But on second thought, our travel app could also explore this direction. Although it feels a bit like a tech utopia, if the app doesn‚Äôt really take off in the future, I would consider fully open-sourcing it and integrating ATProtocol or creating a custom decentralized travel protocol. In this case, the app would simply be an AppView, a display carrier, and the data would be mostly consensus-based on the blockchain. Users would own their own data, which could be a fun and innovative concept.</p> <p>Last night, I recorded a screen capture of the current client situation. After doing a bit of hands-on work, I‚Äôm starting to get a feel for it. I look forward to recording another screen capture this week to share. Over the past few days, I‚Äôve been receiving messages from new friends who are sharing or asking about features in the app. I‚Äôm happy to continuously receive private messages, and we actively consider many great suggestions.

Since I stopped drawing every day, the progress has really picked up! It‚Äôs important to balance things out. For anyone considering independent development, there are a few things we need to handle for an app:</p> <ol> <li>Setting up the code structure and basic framework (this is crucial, but if you have experience with past projects, it‚Äôs usually quick).</li> <li>Product brainstorming ‚Äî those with capability will output mind maps and wireframes.</li> <li>Design work (depending on the size of the product, this can go quickly or slowly, but it‚Äôs a significant task).</li> <li>Database design (for more complex products, this is a major job, but I usually produce this along with backend development).</li> <li>Backend development (its importance depends on the product‚Äôs target scale).</li> <li>Frontend/client-side development (end users are visual beings, while B2B is more function-driven).</li> <li>Integration and testing, reviewing design implementation (details always take up a lot of time and energy, depending on the scale and whether you‚Äôre a perfectionist).</li> </ol> <p>These are the main areas.

When you feel like you want to do something, build something, or even start a business, you need to ask yourself: can you keep going like this for months or even years? Why do I keep emphasizing the power of persistence?

After all, this could be one of the key motivations for many people to continue creating.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Mine Page </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Cursor + Figma to codes </div> <p>Over the past two days, I explored two AI-powered efficiency improvements. The day before yesterday, I used Cursor with Figma to generate prototype images from text. Today, I experimented with using Cursor + Figma to convert design files into Flutter client code. I found the results and efficiency gains of the latter more significant.</p> <p>I‚Äôve attached some images‚Äîby using the simplest prompts and just two iterations, I generated a 60%-complete page. After spending some time refining it, I got the final version. I think this approach is something I‚Äôll continue experimenting with, as I aim to maximize my efficiency.</p> <p>Today, someone with their own product ideas joined our team and will help us focus on data preparation for POI recommendations. I‚Äôm happy to see talented people continuing to join us. Our two product teammates are also actively discussing ideas and defining features.</p> <p>One interesting aspect is that while our prototypes, design files, and development have all progressed to a certain extent, the complete product definition is still catching up. This is mainly because the product team joined later. Initially, I was the one conceptualizing everything, so now we‚Äôre running on two parallel tracks. However, I remain optimistic‚Äîmost functional elements shouldn‚Äôt deviate too much, and UI/UX refinements can be adjusted quickly with some additional effort but still within a manageable scope.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 32%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 17%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, we‚Äôd love to chat!

Everyone is making progress in their respective areas, and we‚Äôll push hard again this weekend. I also worked on the personal profile page a bit‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt the final version yet, just putting in some content for now, and we‚Äôll adjust the layout later.</p> <p>Today, I watched Lei Jun‚Äôs 2024 annual speech, and it resonated with me quite a bit. Overall, I have a lot of respect for him. While he‚Äôs undoubtedly a marketing genius, I still found some really genuine moments in his talk‚Äîespecially his approach to making cars. To truly understand the industry, he test-drove over 170 cars, borrowing them from friends, taking 4S store test drives, and even asking strangers in parking lots. He also led his team to obtain racing licenses, experiencing racing firsthand. Betting everything on one final startup, constantly learning and expanding his knowledge‚Äîthis level of dedication is something I deeply respect. It‚Äôs about truly loving what you do.</p> <p>He also mentioned a 21-day closed-door ‚Äúargument session‚Äù with his core team, where they debated until they fully understood the direction before executing.</p> <p>This is perhaps the mindset every entrepreneur should have‚Äîstripping away the unnecessary fluff and just focusing on getting things done. There‚Äôs no need for grand, empty slogans or overly complex processes. What matters is full commitment from everyone involved. Larger companies often suffer from bureaucracy, pushing employees to become hyper-specialized in their roles. But in a fast-moving team, we need people to be more versatile, aligning under a shared vision to build momentum.</p> <p>Having a deep understanding of what you‚Äôre working on is crucial. Just like with our product‚Äîwe need to first develop our own perspectives on travel before we can shape the product around those insights. Only then can we define our individual roles within this project.</p> <p>I also came across some great quotes about travel while reading a magazine today, but I forgot to take pictures.

It‚Äôs like that well-worn saying, ‚ÄúAI won‚Äôt replace you, but those who know how to use AI will replace you.‚Äù In the internet era, we used to say it‚Äôs no longer the time for big fish to eat small fish, but for fast fish to eat slow fish. I think this phrase is even more fitting for the AI era. The speed of AI advancements is beyond my imagination. I thought of the word ‚Äúmomentum,‚Äù which originally refers to kinetic energy in physics, but in news or articles, it‚Äôs often used to describe a project, team, or event‚Äôs development momentum. I think it‚Äôs a good fit for the AI era. While AI agents and MCPs are already last year‚Äôs things (I‚Äôve thought about this: new technology takes time to flow from research to market, commercial, or public view. Many things last year were still in papers, and we‚Äôre part of the early adopters, so it feels a bit surreal and even confusing, but then it hits us‚Äîwe realize the speed is just overwhelming), the applications emerging this year are coming faster and in greater numbers. If you can‚Äôt keep up, you won‚Äôt stay in place, but rather fall behind on the conveyor belt of time. The reason I work hard to absorb a lot of information, think, learn, and practice is to counter the rigidity that comes with age and experience.</p> <p>As for the team, today two new members joined, focusing on data and UI design. We‚Äôre now 15 people. Do you think that‚Äôs too many? Have you seen this kind of collaboration style?
