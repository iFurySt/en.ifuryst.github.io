There is actually some controversy here, with some people believing this is not best practice. We can see <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/205">the discussion here</a>. That is, now the MCP Server is more often treated as an OAuth authorization server, which is a burden for MCP Server providers. Most MCP Servers tend to be lightweight or microservice-oriented, and requiring them to integrate the corresponding authentication is undoubtedly a huge effort.</p> <p>Based on this, MCP Gateway is currently developing a client-side authentication system, allowing MCP Gateway to adapt to more scenarios, and various services can also connect to MCP Gateway to quickly adapt to authentication scenarios.</p> <p>If you‚Äôre interested in my open-source project, feel free to use, provide feedback, and participate in any contributions:</p> <p>https://github.com/mcp-ecosystem/mcp-gateway</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="AI"/><category term="AI"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official new revised version supports OAuth2 authentication method, let‚Äôs take a look together.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">MCP and Its Role in the AI Era‚ÄîLike HTTP for the Web</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/mcp-vs-http/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="MCP and Its Role in the AI Era‚ÄîLike HTTP for the Web"/><published>2025-05-08T05:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-08T05:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/mcp-vs-http</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/mcp-vs-http/"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past month, the industry has been buzzing:</p> <ul> <li>Two weeks ago, both OpenAI and Amazon announced their adoption of the MCP standard.</li> <li>Last month, Google‚Äôs CEO also mentioned on X that they are considering adopting the MCP standard.</li> </ul> <p>Could MCP become the HTTP of the AI era?</p> <p>I think it‚Äôs still too early to draw that conclusion. Much of the hype seems to come from social media and industry insiders. However, we can‚Äôt ignore the growing trend of MCP adoption. Thanks to media coverage over the past two months, MCP has entered the radar of both technical and non-technical communities.</p> <p>In light of this trend, I‚Äôve started my own exploration‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve always been doing. I‚Äôve noticed that many people have already begun building businesses around MCP application ecosystems. Some MCP Clients, such as Cline, are developing their own App Store-like platforms to make it easier to search for and install MCP Servers. At this stage, most attention is still on MCP Clients. For example, the stdio standard initiated by Anthropic and the use of SSE both lean heavily toward the client side.</p> <p>This makes perfect sense. End-user applications represent a huge opportunity. With the rise of agentic AI, where AIs act as your proxy on the terminal, it‚Äôs natural to integrate them directly with your existing environments. This trend is logical and expected.</p> <p>But in areas still underexplored‚Äîlike remote/cloud/server-side use cases‚Äîwe will likely see an explosion of applications as well. It‚Äôs easy to imagine that the client-heavy approach won‚Äôt fit enterprises or more professional users. MCP is not just for terminals. It will be widely used on the server side, in internal enterprise environments, and for external services.</p> <p>I believe traditional FunctionCalling will gradually shift to MCP. Moreover, many existing APIs will need to be adapted to MCP, which will inevitably lead to the emergence of tools and services to support this transition.</p> <p>That‚Äôs why I created MCP Gateway‚Äîan open-source project I launched in the middle of last month, with the following goals and vision:</p> <ol> <li>Convert existing APIs into MCP Servers through configuration, with zero code changes.</li> <li>Proxy MCP Servers and handle protocol transformations between stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP.</li> <li>Act as a unified gateway for distribution‚Äîa bold comparison would be the ‚ÄúNginx of MCP.‚Äù</li> <li>Extend into MCP service governance. The imagination space is huge‚Äîhow do you manage dozens or hundreds of MCP integrations?</li> <li>Deliver enterprise-grade performance, stability, high availability, and scalability.</li> </ol> <p>In just under a week, the project will hit its one-month mark. I‚Äôve made 160 commits, released 13 versions, and gained over 600 üåü on GitHub. The feedback has been incredibly encouraging, showing me the potential and future applications of this project. I‚Äôm continuing to iterate and improve it. You‚Äôre more than welcome to try it out, share feedback, or join me in building it together ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past month, the industry has been buzzing:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 79/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-79-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 79/100days"/><published>2025-05-06T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-79-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-79-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 7Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>After some careful thought, I‚Äôve decided to bring my Build in Public 100 Days series to a close.

That‚Äôs part of what travel is about, after all. Though, to be honest, this wasn‚Äôt exactly a ‚Äúregular‚Äù trip, since there were plenty of non-travel elements involved as well. I really experienced a lot this time. Fun fact: last night‚Äôs reflections were actually written after drinking, and looking back, I wasn‚Äôt even drunk‚Äîhaha.</p> <p>Interestingly, this trip also brought about some unexpected business opportunities. I think they‚Äôre quite promising‚Äîsomething like a positive feedback loop for the time and energy I‚Äôve invested into AI over the past year or two. I believe we‚Äôre still at the early stage of AI‚Äôs penetration across different industries and applications. More and more opportunities will surface. The major players have their own strategies, while smaller players have a completely different playbook. Whether it‚Äôs toC, toB, or toG, each path has its own dynamics. I think the people or teams that can integrate capital, technology, distribution, business development, and marketing are the ones who will have a real chance to seize the moment in this wave. Just like the internet boom‚Äîit had a lot of hype and bubbles, but also unleashed massive opportunities and created long-tail effects that pushed traditional industries to go digital. The AI era is the same‚Äîit may come with bubbles, and some may burst‚Äîbut the market potential is undeniable.</p> <p>Even though what I write is mostly seen by a small group of tech folks, I remain open-minded and welcome conversations with people from non-technical backgrounds. If you‚Äôre in an industry and want to explore using AI to make something happen, feel free to reach out. Whether it‚Äôs a quick consultation or the possibility of deeper collaboration, I believe 1+1 can be greater than 2.

My mindset shifts significantly.</p> <p>Normally, my focus is on personal growth, consistent output, and the direction and progress of projects and products. In highly social situations, my mental space is taken up by interactions, leaving little room for deep thought. A lot of time gets reallocated to social engagement. During travel, most of my energy goes into experiencing and feeling new things, generating fresh insights and ideas.</p> <p>Personally, I believe all three modes‚Äîbuilding, socializing, and traveling‚Äîare indispensable. It‚Äôs just a matter of how I balance them, which in turn reflects what I value most. While socializing as an adult often emphasizes ‚Äúmeaningful connections,‚Äù I still enjoy the occasional spontaneous interaction. It provides a unique perspective and breaks me out of the fixed mindset that often comes with long-term focus on personal projects or commercial success. In that sense, it feels like a form of emotional compensation.</p> <p>Travel is similar. I love traveling not just for the exposure to new experiences and perspectives, but also because different settings allow me to think from different angles. It doesn‚Äôt have to be deep‚Äîit can be novel and interesting.</p> <p>These past couple of journal entries have felt more like personal diaries, with fewer updates on projects or product development. It feels like the Build in Public series is taking on a different tone now, haha. But I‚Äôll Keep It Real. Regardless of where things stand on Day 100, this has already been a meaningful journey. I hope I can keep up the habit of writing‚Äîthis positive cycle has noticeably improved both my writing speed and my ability to quickly capture and share ideas. It‚Äôs been incredibly helpful for turning input into output.</p> <p>That said, Iter-X‚Äôs progress may have disappointed some long-time followers.

This year‚Äôs May Day travel wave is truly unprecedented. You can tell just from the fully booked flights and the skyrocketing hotel prices, many of which eventually hit full capacity. It‚Äôs even more intense than in previous years, clearly reflecting the continued growth of the domestic tourism industry. But it makes me wonder: how long can this trend really last?</p> <p>From a market perspective, such high travel density during holidays seems unsustainable. Yet considering the limited number of holidays in a year, if not during these times, then when can people actually travel? It‚Äôs a contradictory situation: the cost of traveling during holidays keeps rising, while the quality of service or travel experience may not be satisfying. So how will consumers choose?</p> <p>Let‚Äôs explore some potential solutions:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Develop more attractions to spread out visitors: Many regions are already working on this, but building up attractions takes time. Some locations can attract huge crowds through social media hype, but to make that sustainable, supporting services need to keep up.</p> <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Customized and personalized itineraries: As people visit more destinations, they begin to seek more unique and personalized experiences. This requires professionals in the industry to deeply explore and offer such services. This area is growing, especially in the mid-to-high-end travel market, since profitability allows for better service.</p> <p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Outbound tourism as a form of crowd dispersion: From a national policy standpoint, promoting outbound travel isn‚Äôt ideal due to the outflow of spending power. But for individuals and businesses, it‚Äôs a lucrative opportunity‚Äîoffering significantly different experiences at competitive prices can create a win-win for both consumers and providers.</p> <p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Local and nearby travel (an extension of point 1): Encouraging urban or local tourism‚Äîlike family-friendly countryside retreats‚Äîis a good way to retain travelers within their region.

Went out today and witnessed the sheer number of tourists ‚Äî it was absolutely packed. Despite that, I still managed to release two new versions. High-efficiency output!</p> <p>While I was out, I got inspired with a new idea: an insurance assistant. Right now, due to various reasons, the awareness and acceptance of insurance among many people in China is relatively low. There are several causes, but I believe one major reason is the resistance to salespeople and the headache of trying to understand complex insurance policies. The information gap also leads to major differences in perception. For example, today we encountered a question about whether a 70-year-old can still purchase critical illness insurance, and had to dig through specific policies to find the answer.</p> <p>So I thought ‚Äî what if we collect policy terms and product data from mainstream insurance companies, and use AI + RAG to build a digital insurance advisor? One that helps users quickly identify suitable products based on their needs, while explaining confusing terms in simple language. This would also help educate the market. From what I know, many insurance agents don‚Äôt have strong backgrounds ‚Äî even though that‚Äôs improving, overall professionalism remains uneven.</p> <p>This product could be offered for free, and monetized by partnering with insurance providers ‚Äî earning commissions when users make purchases through the platform. I think this idea has strong potential for commercialization. I haven‚Äôt done formal market research yet (there are probably several competitors already), but I still believe the idea has value. If I choose to pursue it, I‚Äôll likely start by building a version just for myself and close friends, then promote it organically in relevant communities. No monetization in the early phase ‚Äî just focusing on solving real user pain points. I believe that could lead to a solid user base.</p> <p>Have you ever tried an AI doctor that reads medical reports? I found it extremely helpful. In real life, many doctors don‚Äôt have the time or resources to give you thorough explanations. That‚Äôs why some patients become experts over time ‚Äî they‚Äôre forced to. AI doctors can fill this gap well. While they might err on the side of caution in diagnosis, they‚Äôre great for objective education and personalized health advice. You can ask them step-by-step about a new illness, understand its mechanisms, and learn how your habits might contribute to it. That allows you to take targeted action. I believe the same model could work brilliantly in other vertical domains, including insurance.</p> <p>Of course, building a good product is about removing what doesn‚Äôt work, but as a creator or entrepreneur, I think the mindset should be: first identify and amplify what works, then use your ability and resources to fix what doesn‚Äôt. Success might not be far from there. These are two different mindsets I often observe. I wonder ‚Äî which type are you? There‚Äôs no absolute right or wrong ‚Äî just a difference in what suits the path you‚Äôre on.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stay committed</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Have passion</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 7Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 73/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-73-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 73/100days"/><published>2025-04-30T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-30T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-73-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-73-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 7Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Holiday mode has officially begun! My open-source project has hit 571 stars so far ‚Äî exactly 15 days since launch. Users are starting to integrate it and provide feedback, which I‚Äôm really happy about. I‚Äôve set the next milestone at 1k stars, at which point I‚Äôll start working on the Cloud Version, allowing people to configure and experience it directly in the browser. This stage will mostly be free to use.</p> <p>After that, I‚Äôll consider splitting out a commercial version. I haven‚Äôt thought too far ahead yet ‚Äî I‚Äôll decide once we hit the 1k milestone. The commercial edition is part of how I‚Äôm thinking about the project‚Äôs monetization. It‚Äôll likely include some features that are not in the open-source version. Balancing open-source and commercial offerings is tricky:</p> <ul> <li>If you open too much, the commercial version loses appeal.</li> <li>If you open too little, it hurts adoption and community engagement.</li> </ul> <p>This project has become a great case study in building efficiently in the AI era:</p> <ol> <li>Stay sensitive to gaps in the market</li> <li>Move fast ‚Äî build and release an MVP in a few days</li> <li>Launch within niche communities to get early feedback</li> <li>Iterate quickly based on real usage</li> </ol> <p>It‚Äôs a healthy product loop that fits the AI era perfectly.</p> <p>Looking back at Iter-X, I do feel it‚Äôs moving a bit slow ‚Äî though that‚Äôs partly because the to-C (consumer-facing) approach is fundamentally different and demands a higher baseline in terms of stability and design. Still, I‚Äôve learned so much this time around. For example, it‚Äôs hard enough to find a solid full-time co-founder ‚Äî finding reliable collaborators in the part-time pool is even more difficult. Analyzing it this way makes things more understandable.</p> <p>Honestly, building in public has been amazing ‚Äî it forces you to reflect and consolidate your thoughts. Even if the product I plan to launch on Day 100 doesn‚Äôt go live, I‚Äôll have gained a ton of experience and growth just by going through the process.</p> <p>By the way, I‚Äôm working on a new idea with a very clear revenue model (already validated in the market). I‚Äôm actively doing feasibility research during this holiday break. I might go the solopreneur route for this one. I‚Äôm not ready to share details just yet, but if you have strong hands-on experience and deep understanding of AI applications, feel free to reach out. If this idea works out, I‚Äôll need long-term collaborators focused on AI at the application layer.</p> <p>‚∏ª</p> <p>Current progress recap:</p> <ol> <li>UI/UX &amp; prototype design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you check these boxes, come talk to me:</p> <ol> <li>You can commit long-term</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You‚Äôre genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 7Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 72/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-72-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 72/100days"/><published>2025-04-29T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-29T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-72-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-72-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 7Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>The holidays are coming, and it‚Äôs time to get out and explore a bit. It‚Äôs been almost three months since I returned from the US for Chinese New Year, and I‚Äôve been working intensely ever since. Time to enjoy some good food and fun.</p> <p>I started this travel app 72 days ago because of my love for traveling‚Äînever forget why you started. That said, I really don‚Äôt enjoy crowded places; being stuck in a sea of people ruins the experience for me. That‚Äôs also why I especially love traveling abroad. I feel many people have the means to travel internationally, but in reality, only a small portion actually go‚Äîand even fewer do so consistently.</p> <p>I want to shape this app into a platform for recording life experiences. Right now, most of our memories are scattered across notes, photos, videos, social media posts, and, of course, our minds. But it made me wonder: how do people generally treat their memories? Some people revisit beautiful moments often, some always look ahead, and some fall somewhere in between. I‚Äôm in the middle‚ÄîI rarely scroll back through old photos or videos, but when I see something related, a memory fragment will resurface.</p> <p>Sorting through travel photos and related memories takes a lot of effort, and I believe AI can solve a significant part of that pain.</p> <p>Progress so far:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you fit the following, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 7Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry></feed>
