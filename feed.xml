I worked on breaking down the product a bit, drew up the architecture diagram, and came up with a preliminary AI solution. We are still going with the FunctionCall+Agent approach, where different functional agents are called via registered tools. There will be two types of tools: one that is adjustable within the program and one that can be invoked during LLM inference. The reason for breaking down the agents into smaller atomic ones is to make them more vertically specialized, allowing for continuous optimization and iteration in specific areas. This will help avoid the problem where optimizing one area causes regressions in another. We can better optimize based on benchmarks for a specific area and improve it. The Routing layer will handle intent recognition or function differentiation to route requests to different agents. This should cover our use cases.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Finalized Trip Design Diagram </div> <p>In the evening, I organized and consolidated several pages. The Figma Mirror is really useful. The thickness, font size, spacing, etc., that were previously not designed well are now getting real-time feedback. It’s a “what you see is what you get” process, and the final version was done very quickly. We’ve now locked this version, and both the client and backend can quickly break it down and start working on it. Over the past two days, I’ve realized we need to stick to agile as much as possible. We can’t pursue perfection; it’s better to have something first and iterate. Even if we have to make changes to the pages later due to product shape modifications, the cost won’t be too high, and it’s acceptable. It’s not easy going from 0 to 1, but it’s relatively easier from 1 to 10. Small steps with rapid progress will allow us to reach our MVP by Day 100, or even earlier 🚀. We’ve completed 1/4 of the time, and are we 1/4 of the way there? Overall, we are making progress 🥳.</p> <p>Summary of the current status:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 25%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 22%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) progress: 6%</li> <li>Data: 6%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following conditions, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣5️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 24/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-24-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 24/100days"/><published>2025-03-12T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-12T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-24-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-24-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣4️⃣</p> <p>Today I had a chat with ChatGPT and got a cool fact. At least that’s what he said: Octopuses have three hearts. Two hearts are responsible for pumping blood to the gills, and the third heart pumps blood to the rest of the body. And when an octopus swims, the heart that pumps blood to the body stops beating.</p> <p>I thought this was more of a niche fact, haha, but it’s definitely interesting. When I heard him say it, I was a bit taken aback—Octopus, Three Hearts? I double-checked what he said to make sure I wasn’t hearing things. Pretty cool, right? We also talked about Ostriches. Apparently, they’re one of the fastest land animals, capable of running at speeds up to 70 km/h. That’s really fast. In comparison, the fastest land animal, the Cheetah, can only run at 113 km/h for about 20-30 seconds.</p> <p>This year of practicing English has felt like reliving my childhood (from a language-learning perspective). There’s so much you don’t know, so much you don’t know how to ask. It’s like rediscovering knowledge you didn’t pay attention to before. I have to say, AI has completely changed us in every way. It’s like how we talk about FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)—this kind of emotional state where you’re afraid to miss out on important opportunities, events, or experiences. I think FOMO can be a great motivator, pushing you to keep up and not get left behind in the AI age. I could easily throw out a dozen examples of how AI impacts individuals, companies, and various other areas, but this isn’t an AI class, so I’ll stop here.</p> <p>Our product is also trying to leverage AI to deliver a better, more valuable, human-centered app for travelers and tourists. We really need creative people. You can come in as an advisor to bounce ideas, or you can contribute your talents to change parts of the product. I even think we could treat it like a kind of art piece. We want to succeed commercially, but we’re not just aiming for commercial success. Art-based works inevitably influence the audience, as the work is largely shaped by the creator team. So, I really hope to seek out a diverse team. I believe that someone’s contribution to a team isn’t necessarily measured by the amount of work they do. They can contribute in many ways, and whether someone fits into a team is a two-way process. It’s not easy to find a great team, but we have to keep looking for the right fit. Social platforms give us the chance to discover people, and our reach has gone global beyond just the third-degree connections (in a sense, it’s also the people who love the internet…). It’s a great time to be alive! With more and more people realizing the potential of nonlinear careers or personal development, I hope what I’m sharing here can plant some seeds in your mind. In the future, it might help guide you down a path less traveled, and that might take a lot of courage and awareness. (Maybe it will also give your future self a little push).</p> <p>As you can imagine, when I’m saying all this unrelated stuff, it’s because there isn’t much significant product progress to report 😒. That’s all.

There’s quite a large amount of data, and the data team has already been dispatched. The backend team has also begun to provide the corresponding point of interest APIs.</p> <p>The design progress is still a bit slower than expected, and in the next couple of days, I’ll need to align with the product team to finalize some ideas. For now, I’m thinking of releasing early and iterating. Over the next few days, I plan to have the client and backend teams work on some of the pages that are less likely to change significantly, so we can move forward progressively.

I’m really looking forward to finishing the design so I can fully roll out everything. A teammate saw my post from the day before yesterday and told me about a feature in the Figma mobile app — the mirror function. It allows you to cast the page you’re editing on your computer to your phone in real-time. How cool is that! Haha, turns out I was the fool. Most of tonight was spent optimizing details, going through previous pages, and viewing them live on my phone so I could quickly align everything.</p> <p>I originally planned to just let things slide, but then a teammate reached out to me saying they wanted to join us. They wrote me a little essay and mentioned they found me through V2EX and my blog, where they saw the content from the first 21 days. I was actually quite touched. As I shared in my first online meetup, I’m really grateful that I started building in public with a 0/100 mindset. It’s led me to meet so many incredible people with great ideas, and I’ve had a lot of enriching conversations. It feels amazing to know that others believe in my vision and are willing to team up to make it happen. It’s like traveling — the destination isn’t what matters most; it’s the scenery along the way. Just enjoy it, and that’s enough! 🤘</p> <p>BTW, I think one extra benefit of building in public is the dopamine effect. Never underestimate the power of physiology. A lot of people can’t keep going because they don’t understand how to leverage things like dopamine to keep themselves motivated. It’s not about just struggling to persist; it’s about enjoying the process. Knowing how to use your strengths and also boosting them with some inner and external forces to reinforce those strengths. Getting a bit off track here, but anyway, I’m going to sleep. These past few days have been too late, and things are starting to catch fire in the back yard. 🧑🏿‍💻</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX design: 23%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 18%</li> <li>Mobile client (Flutter): 5%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persist</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Is interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣2️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 21/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-21-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 21/100days"/><published>2025-03-09T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-09T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-21-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-21-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣1️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> 1s Online Meetup Keynote </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> 1s Online Meetup Keynote </div> <p>Today was the first online meetup, and it went smoothly. Everyone joined in, and we formally got to know each other. The team member from California stayed up until 3 AM to join us 🧑🏿‍💻. We aligned on the vision and ideas behind the product, as well as future plans. Several team members shared what they’ve been working on, and I truly saw the diversity in thoughts. I really liked the following paradigm:</p> <p>Cross-age + Cross-region + Different Experiences + Different Abilities + Ideas + AI = ?</p> <p>We have partners from three different age groups, with various experiences, backgrounds, and regions. Everyone has their own ideas, and at the intersection of the AI era, perhaps something great can spark. The product is just the vehicle, and AI is just the assist; what really makes things happen is turning great ideas into reality in the new context of this era (middle-aged + young people, old ideas + new ideas), and delivering them to people. The long-term value is the key—markets not only need profitable products but products that are valuable and useful to people.</p> <p>To conclude: No app or project will succeed overnight.

This way, you can preview the design on your phone ahead of time. It gives a much more intuitive feel than viewing it on a computer. I went through all my pages this way today and found several design issues, especially with font weights, spacing, rectangle sizes, etc. I fixed all the problematic areas. On a large computer screen, everything looks fine because the high-fidelity images can be resized to any comfortable zoom level, but on the phone, it’s much more intuitive. You can immediately spot what doesn’t look right, and your instincts will tell you what needs fixing.</p> <p>I also managed to write a few pages of a PowerPoint because tomorrow is my first meetup. I hope to connect with everyone and take the opportunity to review why I started working on this product, along with some related ideas and features. After the meetup, I’ll be able to share some of the PPT content.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TripDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-06-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TripDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-06-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TripDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-06-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TripDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-06.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TimeRangePickerDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-21-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TimeRangePickerDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-21-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TimeRangePickerDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-21-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/TimeRangePickerDesign.2025-03-09_00-18-21.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Design </div> <p>Yesterday, I scrapped the design of the main itinerary page that I worked on 10 days ago, and today, I scrapped the design I made yesterday.

Now that I’ve designed more pages, looking back at the earlier ones, I see a lot of inconsistencies. Over the next few days, I’ll gradually define these specifications and go back to correct the earlier designs.</p> <p>Today, my teammate combined the design mockups with code and after reviewing around ten market competitors, we’ve compiled a mind map with some functional and interaction frameworks. We plan to discuss this in our meetup on Sunday. Tomorrow, I’ll organize the product background, philosophy, and goals to align everyone on the same page. I expect to finish the trip-focused design next week, and if everything goes smoothly, we can start backend and frontend development, and also integrate AI. Currently, we are considering the AI integration, especially where it fits in and how to define its boundaries. If AI were to take full control, we might need an intent recognition routing system to direct tasks to the appropriate agent.</p> <p>Current Progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 20%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 16%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 3%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Is interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣9️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 18/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-18-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 18/100days"/><published>2025-03-06T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-06T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-18-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-18-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day1️⃣8️⃣</p> <p>I’m really frustrated with WeChat.

The entire evening was spent connecting with others. This weekend, we plan to hold the first online meetup for the core team, with a casual and relaxed tone. There will be roughly three parts: first, a chance for everyone to get to know each other; second, sharing backgrounds, initial intentions, and recent insights from discussions with various online communities; third, a casual chat about the future pace, collaboration, and overall direction of the product.</p> <p>Today, I came across a quote from Poor Charlie’s Almanack from June 2021:</p> <p>“The species that survive are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the ones most adaptable to change.”</p> <p>I hope that in the AI era, we can all adapt to this new age. The tangible changes are already upon us and will continue to come, just like the saying in Alice in Wonderland, “We’re all just running to stay in the same place.” 🫡</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 16%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 15%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 3%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following conditions, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Have a dream</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 16/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 16/100days"/><published>2025-03-04T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-04T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day1️⃣6️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Coming Soon </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Coming Soon </div> <p>To keep it short, the registration has been approved.
