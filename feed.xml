You input “3-day trip to Hangzhou,” and it starts planning. It even outputs the reasoning process of the model. I suddenly felt a bit absurd – the user just entered these five words, and AI is already thinking? It feels almost magical. It doesn’t even ask for user preferences. Is this kind of forced reasoning really thinking? I feel like many product teams today are missing the point. It’s like the famous story of Steve Jobs talking to his engineers. Today, many teams make the same mistake: they prioritize technology over product. Essentially, it’s “AI first.” In reality, we should start from the user. Only then should we think about whether this technology is needed, where it’s needed, to what extent, and what it can achieve. This is the logical direction to consider. Of course, I understand that FOMO, KPIs, and other pressures can lead to this approach, but just because it’s “necessary” doesn’t mean it’s the right approach.</p> <p>I even think we should let AI have a certain attitude. For instance, if you provide too little information, we shouldn’t recommend anything. Because it’s easy to recommend incorrectly, and the outcome could be: 1) The user feels like it doesn’t work and quits. 2) The user manually deletes the recommendation. 3) Or the user keeps asking AI to optimize it. Essentially, we’re wasting computational power, which equals burning money to satisfy unclear needs, guessing user preferences in a labor-intensive way, which is not productive.</p> <p>If we must force AI to recommend based on such limited information, that’s fine. We can go with a safer, more generic approach. This can meet the needs of the majority of users, especially those visiting a place for the first time. The chances are they will want to see the more famous attractions.</p> <p>Another point is that recommendations need to be justified. The reason for recommending a specific POI should be clear to the user because users have the final decision. For example, when browsing travel spots on platforms like Xiaohongshu or social media, you don’t visit all the top 10 places. You will only go to those that interest you. The key is understanding why something interests you.</p> <p>I still think we need to return to the original goal: start with a useful itinerary planner, then make it smarter. Many products today only focus on a direction or a few points, but what users expect is a complete product. We want to deliver this complete product. Now, I actually feel happier and lighter because the real concern for me was the financial pressure AI would bring. If we can get our approach right, maybe we don’t need such high upfront costs to validate whether the market believes in our vision.</p> <p>Current status summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 29%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 30%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter) progress: 8%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner👾):</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Ambition</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day3️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 33/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-33-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 33/100days"/><published>2025-03-21T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-21T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-33-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-33-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day3️⃣3️⃣</p> <p>No significant progress updates today—I’m still evaluating options for full-text search and haven’t finished yet.

Tomorrow, I’ll continue working on the AI workflow. I also had a chat with two product teammates, and along with my recent thoughts, I took some time to brainstorm ideas.</p> <p>Lately, I came across another person doing a “Build in Public 100 Days” challenge, also working on a travel app. Several friends mentioned it to me today and even asked if we were on the same team—haha. This also led me to write an article yesterday reflecting on our product, going back to the core idea, and defining why our product can survive in the market, what makes it different, and what value it brings to users. This actually helped me further clarify my thoughts. I believe delivering a good product to the market isn’t the hard part—survival is. Entering the travel planning app space sometimes feels like “seeking my own demise.” After all, the dominant players in this industry are OTAs (Online Travel Agencies), which hold the key B2B resources and have massive user bases—an enormous moat. On the other hand, many products that started as tools have struggled to monetize, leading to shutdowns. Another challenge is the low barrier to entry—many people can build similar products, and independent creators often go for small, niche, and paid products.</p> <p>So, why start despite all this? Anyone with some business knowledge can analyze these challenges, but I believe the world still needs a bit of irrationality and courage. Andrea used a word today that I found fitting—Utopia. Deep down, my rational self still holds a touch of impulsive passion, perhaps influenced by my wild, self-taught experience in the arts. I enjoy painting bold strokes of creativity against a logical backdrop.</p> <p>Right now, no single app allows me to fully manage my travel experience from start to finish. Travelers today are “Frankenstein users,” constantly piecing together information from different sources, recording bits here and there. Travel can be a one-time, fleeting joy or a lifelong collection of experiences—it all depends on how you define it. I want to create an app that I can use for a lifetime.</p> <p>Current Progress:</p> <ul> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 28%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 27%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 8%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ul> <p>If you match the following criteria, let’s talk!

The PR is still in DRAFT status and isn’t fully completed yet; it’s expected to take another two days to finish. In the evenings, I managed to spare some time to refactor and optimize the main itinerary page. It’s still a half-finished project, but over the past month of practice, my understanding of prototype + UI design has improved. However, there’s still a long way to go in terms of aesthetics. I plan to take some time to further develop my taste and artistic sense. I actually get quite anxious when I see others’ designs not aligning with my vision. I think many people feel the same way—most will just say they don’t like something or that it’s not good enough, but they might struggle to pinpoint exactly what’s wrong. I’m really fond of the concept of being a polymath or a learned person, someone who has deep knowledge in a few areas. For an independent creator, it feels like knowing just one thing isn’t enough. You need to have unique insights in several areas to see clearly on the big picture and understand the details as well.</p> <p>Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, MCP—if you haven’t been paying attention to these keywords lately, you might want to take note. These are currently trending in the frontier fields, and I’ve been experimenting with applying them in real projects and engineering. There are a lot of thoughts and feelings around this. AI replacing most jobs is definitely not just hype. If you try it seriously, you’ll be disheartened to realize how fragile many professions are under the relentless forward momentum of AI. Based on this, you have to stay on track and not get left behind. Don’t be fooled by the overwhelming Demo-style marketing online. Many exaggerated self-media channels can gradually lull you into complacency. The consequence is that you’ll miss out on new trends simply because you weren’t aware.

The plan is to first implement the PlanAgent and streamline the process, so that the entire framework is thought through and other people can contribute based on this direction. I’m planning to stick to the previous design where we register multiple agents, and each agent can register a series of toolsets. This way, each agent can share tools when handling specific tasks. Currently, agents don’t communicate with each other, because the main goal right now is to integrate AI into the business layer’s various modules. Later, when we have a fully controlled AI, we will extract a main scheduling role in the business layer, where we can consider implementing multi-agent coordination to complete a task. This will also integrate routing gating. Overall, we’ll still follow a multi-layered architecture where the upper layers can repeatedly reuse lower-layer instances, and lower layers are treated as “atomic capabilities” by the upper layers.</p> <p>Summary of the current situation:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 25%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 23%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 6%</li> <li>Data: 6%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (maybe check out Day 6 first):</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 26/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-26-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 26/100days"/><published>2025-03-14T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-14T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-26-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-26-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣6️⃣</p> <p>Today, I’m not even sure what I did the whole day. In the evening, I was tinkering with other things, and now it’s already 11 PM, only now I have time to look at things. Recently, the question about the future profitability model for the product has come up again. Given that it’s hard to make a profit in the early stages and it requires burning money to support the business, will we be able to survive long enough to build up the user base? It’s a very realistic issue, and that’s why many startups are aiming for a paid app direction. I think building a product itself isn’t that hard; the real challenge comes with the market and operations afterwards. A solid product foundation only helps, but it doesn’t cover up these issues.</p> <p>Aside from that, I think international travel is a relatively less competitive market. Many apps don’t have a sufficiently good product for it. International travel is a growing market, and its scale will continue to expand, making it a worthwhile direction to invest in. However, international travel has a natural disadvantage compared to domestic travel, which is the lower frequency of trips. In the domestic market, we can focus on high-frequency travel, which increases the number of times and frequency that users engage with the app. So I believe it’s essential to combine both, leveraging the strengths of each, to offer a smoother travel experience in one app. Travel is something that lasts a lifetime, and I hope everyone who is physically and mentally on the road can slowly record and leave many memories and mementos. As you travel to more places, you can accumulate and experience more people and things, different encounters. I believe many people don’t or aren’t willing to put in the effort to document their trips through social media, but human memory doesn’t stand up well to the test of time. We may only remember certain things from five years ago, and many of them fade away, lying forgotten in photo albums or videos. Perhaps we can leverage technology and well-thought-out design to deliver a great platform that helps people record every significant journey for the long term.</p> <p>However, vision, ideals, and aspirations need practical support. After climbing high and looking far, we must still walk steadily and take every step seriously. Not everything is about results; the process is something we should enjoy at all times.</p> <p>Travel is never a matter of money but of courage. — Paulo Coelho</p> <p>Back to the beginning, perhaps money isn’t our biggest concern after all—courage is. Knowing when to step back is modern wisdom, and courage to move forward is a unique trait of a traveler’s heart. ❤️</p> <p>Summary of the current status:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 25%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 22%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 6%</li> <li>Data: 6%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following conditions, feel free to reach out (maybe start by checking out Day 6’s content):</p> <ol> <li>Perseverance</li> <li>Dream</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣6️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 25/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-25-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 25/100days"/><published>2025-03-13T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-13T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-25-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-25-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣5️⃣</p> <p>Today was super fast-paced. I worked on breaking down the product a bit, drew up the architecture diagram, and came up with a preliminary AI solution. We are still going with the FunctionCall+Agent approach, where different functional agents are called via registered tools. There will be two types of tools: one that is adjustable within the program and one that can be invoked during LLM inference. The reason for breaking down the agents into smaller atomic ones is to make them more vertically specialized, allowing for continuous optimization and iteration in specific areas. This will help avoid the problem where optimizing one area causes regressions in another. We can better optimize based on benchmarks for a specific area and improve it. The Routing layer will handle intent recognition or function differentiation to route requests to different agents. This should cover our use cases.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/1.2025-03-14_01-07-13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/2.2025-03-14_01-07-24.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/3.2025-03-14_01-07-32.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/4.2025-03-14_01-07-38.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/5.2025-03-14_01-07-44.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-13-iter-x-25-100/6.2025-03-14_01-07-49.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Finalized Trip Design Diagram </div> <p>In the evening, I organized and consolidated several pages. The Figma Mirror is really useful. The thickness, font size, spacing, etc., that were previously not designed well are now getting real-time feedback. It’s a “what you see is what you get” process, and the final version was done very quickly. We’ve now locked this version, and both the client and backend can quickly break it down and start working on it. Over the past two days, I’ve realized we need to stick to agile as much as possible. We can’t pursue perfection; it’s better to have something first and iterate. Even if we have to make changes to the pages later due to product shape modifications, the cost won’t be too high, and it’s acceptable. It’s not easy going from 0 to 1, but it’s relatively easier from 1 to 10. Small steps with rapid progress will allow us to reach our MVP by Day 100, or even earlier 🚀. We’ve completed 1/4 of the time, and are we 1/4 of the way there?
