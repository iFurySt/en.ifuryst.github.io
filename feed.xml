There’s quite a large amount of data, and the data team has already been dispatched. The backend team has also begun to provide the corresponding point of interest APIs.</p> <p>The design progress is still a bit slower than expected, and in the next couple of days, I’ll need to align with the product team to finalize some ideas. For now, I’m thinking of releasing early and iterating. Over the next few days, I plan to have the client and backend teams work on some of the pages that are less likely to change significantly, so we can move forward progressively. This week, I’ll also be working on an architecture diagram for the AI side and thinking through the overall flow for AI interaction.</p> <p>Here’s a summary of the current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 23%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 19%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 5%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣3️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 22/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-22-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 22/100days"/><published>2025-03-10T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-10T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-22-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-22-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣2️⃣</p> <p>Today, I took some time to write code and noticed that I’ve already made 76 commits. I’m really looking forward to finishing the design so I can fully roll out everything. A teammate saw my post from the day before yesterday and told me about a feature in the Figma mobile app — the mirror function. It allows you to cast the page you’re editing on your computer to your phone in real-time. How cool is that! Haha, turns out I was the fool. Most of tonight was spent optimizing details, going through previous pages, and viewing them live on my phone so I could quickly align everything.</p> <p>I originally planned to just let things slide, but then a teammate reached out to me saying they wanted to join us. They wrote me a little essay and mentioned they found me through V2EX and my blog, where they saw the content from the first 21 days. I was actually quite touched. As I shared in my first online meetup, I’m really grateful that I started building in public with a 0/100 mindset. It’s led me to meet so many incredible people with great ideas, and I’ve had a lot of enriching conversations. It feels amazing to know that others believe in my vision and are willing to team up to make it happen. It’s like traveling — the destination isn’t what matters most; it’s the scenery along the way. Just enjoy it, and that’s enough! 🤘</p> <p>BTW, I think one extra benefit of building in public is the dopamine effect. Never underestimate the power of physiology. A lot of people can’t keep going because they don’t understand how to leverage things like dopamine to keep themselves motivated. It’s not about just struggling to persist; it’s about enjoying the process. Knowing how to use your strengths and also boosting them with some inner and external forces to reinforce those strengths. Getting a bit off track here, but anyway, I’m going to sleep. These past few days have been too late, and things are starting to catch fire in the back yard. 🧑🏿‍💻</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX design: 23%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 18%</li> <li>Mobile client (Flutter): 5%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persist</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Is interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣2️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 21/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-21-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 21/100days"/><published>2025-03-09T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-09T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-21-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-21-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣1️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote1.2025-03-09_23-37-23.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote2.2025-03-09_23-37-52.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> 1s Online Meetup Keynote </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-07.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-09-iter-x-21-100/Keynote3.2025-03-09_23-38-22.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> 1s Online Meetup Keynote </div> <p>Today was the first online meetup, and it went smoothly. Everyone joined in, and we formally got to know each other. The team member from California stayed up until 3 AM to join us 🧑🏿‍💻. We aligned on the vision and ideas behind the product, as well as future plans. Several team members shared what they’ve been working on, and I truly saw the diversity in thoughts. I really liked the following paradigm:</p> <p>Cross-age + Cross-region + Different Experiences + Different Abilities + Ideas + AI = ?</p> <p>We have partners from three different age groups, with various experiences, backgrounds, and regions. Everyone has their own ideas, and at the intersection of the AI era, perhaps something great can spark. The product is just the vehicle, and AI is just the assist; what really makes things happen is turning great ideas into reality in the new context of this era (middle-aged + young people, old ideas + new ideas), and delivering them to people. The long-term value is the key—markets not only need profitable products but products that are valuable and useful to people.</p> <p>To conclude: No app or project will succeed overnight. Enjoy the process, and pursue what you want. There’s no shortcut, just brainpower, persistence, and effort leading to success.</p> <p>Let’s Rock! 🚀</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 23%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 17%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 5%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Ability to persist</li> <li>Dreamer</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day2️⃣1️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 20/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-20-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 20/100days"/><published>2025-03-08T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-08T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-20-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-20-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day2️⃣0️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone1.2025-03-09_00-39-16-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone1.2025-03-09_00-39-16-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone1.2025-03-09_00-39-16-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone1.2025-03-09_00-39-16.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone2.2025-03-08_21-03-05-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone2.2025-03-08_21-03-05-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone2.2025-03-08_21-03-05-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-08-iter-x-20-100/DesignInIPhone2.2025-03-08_21-03-05.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Preview design on mobile </div> <p>Today, I discovered a useful design validation tip: open Figma or a screenshot on your phone and zoom in until it matches the size of a phone screen. This way, you can preview the design on your phone ahead of time. It gives a much more intuitive feel than viewing it on a computer. I went through all my pages this way today and found several design issues, especially with font weights, spacing, rectangle sizes, etc. I fixed all the problematic areas. On a large computer screen, everything looks fine because the high-fidelity images can be resized to any comfortable zoom level, but on the phone, it’s much more intuitive. You can immediately spot what doesn’t look right, and your instincts will tell you what needs fixing.</p> <p>I also managed to write a few pages of a PowerPoint because tomorrow is my first meetup. I hope to connect with everyone and take the opportunity to review why I started working on this product, along with some related ideas and features.

I expect to finish the trip-focused design next week, and if everything goes smoothly, we can start backend and frontend development, and also integrate AI. Currently, we are considering the AI integration, especially where it fits in and how to define its boundaries.

I applied for access to their open platform, and they rejected me 5 or 6 times. It’s so ridiculous. We’re still in the design and development stage, without any trademarks or software copyrights, and they just won’t approve it. It’s infuriating. Their response was something like, “It might involve using others’ app flow diagrams for submission.” So how should I prove that this is something we’ve designed ourselves?

While the time and energy of each person may vary, and we can’t compete with full-time teams, I still choose to believe in the power of belief.</p> <p>From the project’s perspective, there wasn’t much progress today. The entire evening was spent connecting with others. This weekend, we plan to hold the first online meetup for the core team, with a casual and relaxed tone. There will be roughly three parts: first, a chance for everyone to get to know each other; second, sharing backgrounds, initial intentions, and recent insights from discussions with various online communities; third, a casual chat about the future pace, collaboration, and overall direction of the product.</p> <p>Today, I came across a quote from Poor Charlie’s Almanack from June 2021:</p> <p>“The species that survive are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the ones most adaptable to change.”</p> <p>I hope that in the AI era, we can all adapt to this new age. The tangible changes are already upon us and will continue to come, just like the saying in Alice in Wonderland, “We’re all just running to stay in the same place.” 🫡</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 16%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 15%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 3%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following conditions, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Have a dream</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 16/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 16/100days"/><published>2025-03-04T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-04T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-16-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day1️⃣6️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon1.2025-03-04_23-51-38.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon2.2025-03-04_23-51-51.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Coming Soon </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon3.2025-03-04_23-52-20.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-04-iter-x-16-100/ComingSoon4.2025-03-04_23-52-27.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Coming Soon </div> <p>To keep it short, the registration has been approved.

When jumping straight into coding, you can work with vague ideas, but if you need to make adjustments during the implementation, the cost becomes quite high. On the other hand, dragging and dropping elements in Figma requires much less effort, and sometimes you can experiment and expand your thoughts.</p> <p>Although I’ve worked on many projects before, this time I’ve taken a more serious approach to design, controlling the details and thinking about interactions from scratch. I can’t help but feel that even the simplest MVP requires a lot of effort, and I have great respect for solo founders. Recently, I’ve noticed a phenomenon on several platforms—many people are very FOMO (especially during the period when I was inspired by DeepSeek). They’re anxious, scared that they’ll fall behind after just a day or two and miss the opportunity to make money. However, some things just can’t be rushed. Although the startup market is all about racing against time, fearing that a second could mean losing the market, I still lean toward a long-term approach. Technology moves in waves, and you never know which wave will be the biggest or the one that helps you stand up. What you can do is keep sharpening yourself on the sea. You only need to catch a wave or two and manage to stand up—then it’s enough. Always remember, the tide will eventually go out, and how many will be left with their pants down?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Creation Page Design </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Creation Page Design </div> <p>Today, I turned an idea for a city selection page into reality, and it feels great. I love the feeling of creation, like coding or painting—creating something from nothing. I enjoy it! I had originally planned to outsource the design, but since I shifted my focus to academics and exam prep, I had to take this responsibility on myself. I think it’s a blessing in disguise, as it allows me to fully bring my ideas to life. Though at times I’ve struggled with my aesthetics and design skills, I still strive to learn from excellent and eye-catching designs. I also often talk with designers I know to get feedback on my ideas and ask for help. However, I’ve realized that design is really subjective; each designer’s style is unique. So, I often don’t agree with some design ideas, and it leads to lots of back-and-forth discussions and revisions. But it’s also great—sometimes we exchange ideas, try things out, and new results come out of it. I’d love to have the chance in the future to make some merchandise for this app to give to users and key creators 🤡</p> <p>Here’s an update on the current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 15%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 14%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 3%</li> <li>Data: 5%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Has an interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry></feed>
