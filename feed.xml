It broadened my perspective. I’ve been overlooking the frequent traveler group, or rather, for some interesting, deep, and unique cities, certain experiences are not just about visiting popular spots or fulfilling conventional travel needs. Over the next couple of days, I’ll re-organize my thoughts and think about the long-term development and direction of this product. Grateful for the encounter, the insights, and the exchange of ideas 😊</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Buffet24ar.2025-02-27_17-43-35-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Buffet24ar.2025-02-27_17-43-35-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Buffet24ar.2025-02-27_17-43-35-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Buffet24ar.2025-02-27_17-43-35.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Screenshot of Berkshire Hathaway's 2024 Annual Report </div> <p>I read a few pages of Berkshire Hathaway’s 2024 annual report today and marked a couple of quotes from Buffett. One of them was:</p> <p>“One further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!”</p> <p>In essence, he does not consider a candidate’s school background when choosing a CEO. Despite having studied at three prestigious schools himself, he firmly believes in lifelong learning. Many business geniuses don’t need academic credentials to prove themselves. The business world naturally fosters talented people through experience.</p> <p>I’m also a strong advocate for lifelong learning. I always believe that broad learning can unlock infinite potential. Modern society has categorized various disciplines, transforming people into specialists, which makes sense for maximizing social efficiency as complexity increases. (However, the social optimum doesn’t always equal the individual optimum.)</p> <p>This easily traps most people into a preconceived notion, creating barriers that are so ingrained that we never question them. I remember Da Vinci as a polymath who excelled across several fields. I think in this AI-powered era, the potential to accumulate and learn information is far beyond what the internet era could offer. If you want to learn, you can access nearly all of humanity’s knowledge— the only barrier to learning is within yourself. The obsession with degrees is merely a way for employers to reduce hiring costs in the job market. It’s not the only standard and certainly not an objective one. Don’t let degrees or academic fields blind you— your boundaries may go far beyond that.</p> <p>Recently, several people have asked if they can join, and as I mentioned in my previous co-creation initiative, it’s not about whether you can join. If you’re willing to try, you’re welcome. We maintain an open mindset to welcome everyone and also respect those who choose to leave silently.</p> <p>A new member who can draw has joined today and will help with some of the design tasks 🎉</p> <p>Today, I further refined the details of the daily itinerary page and began adding the location pages. Traditional search features are included, and the voice integration will follow soon.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design1.2025-02-28_00-00-30-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design1.2025-02-28_00-00-30-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design1.2025-02-28_00-00-30-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design1.2025-02-28_00-00-30.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design2.2025-02-28_00-00-53-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design2.2025-02-28_00-00-53-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design2.2025-02-28_00-00-53-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design2.2025-02-28_00-00-53.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design3.2025-02-28_00-01-25-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design3.2025-02-28_00-01-25-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design3.2025-02-28_00-01-25-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-27-iter-x-11-100/Design3.2025-02-28_00-01-25.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Daily itinerary page design </div> <p>Summary of the current status:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 10%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 11%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 3%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you fit the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have big dreams</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣1️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 10/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-10-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 10/100days"/><published>2025-02-26T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-26T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-10-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-10-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day1️⃣0️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Design.2025-02-26_23-43-52-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Design.2025-02-26_23-43-52-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Design.2025-02-26_23-43-52-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Design.2025-02-26_23-43-52.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Sticker.2025-02-26_23-53-14-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Sticker.2025-02-26_23-53-14-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Sticker.2025-02-26_23-53-14-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-26-iter-x-10-100/Sticker.2025-02-26_23-53-14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Itinerary Page Design &amp; Sticker </div> <p>100 days have passed, and we’re already 1/10 through. Time flies. The biggest challenge for me today is the Revenue Model. Our product is destined to be a free product, so we need to think about how to survive during the early stages of development, as there will be no revenue for the time being. I’m also starting to look into angel investments, although we haven’t hit MVP or PMF yet, I think it’s reasonable to start thinking and preparing now. Once I finish the prototype and UI design, I’ll also begin working on the BP, as it will help organize my thoughts and clarify any chaotic or unclear ideas.</p> <p>Today, we have a new team member who specializes in data and AI 😎. Now our team has more than one person working on each major direction, which helps with collaboration and discussions. However, I’m still hoping to find someone who can draw or create personalized stickers. If you’re out there, come hit me up (no need to be a professional artist—AI-generated images that you then modify are also totally fine!).</p> <p>Today, I completed part of the daily itinerary design, and I’m actually quite satisfied with this version. I’m not from a design background, so I’m a bit of a self-taught designer, but I’ve learned some valuable lessons. One thing I’ve found is that in design, it’s common to end up scrapping everything you’ve previously done and starting over. I think this is a fairly frequent occurrence because you need to consider the prototype, UI, and UX all at once. In this situation, many ideas remain vague and chaotic, so it’s not always possible to settle on the final version right from the start. This process requires exploration and experimentation. I think that’s why I admire creators so much, including artists. It’s difficult to create something from nothing, but modifying something that already exists is much easier. So, I think this is normal. If you’re pursuing excellence, you need to focus on user experience, operational smoothness, and convenience, while also paying attention to aesthetics—making sure the design stands out and gives users that “wow” feeling. On top of that, you need to consider the implementation cost because many designs look great but are costly to implement.</p> <p>Summary of the current status:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 10%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 11%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 3%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you fit the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have big dreams</li> <li>Are interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day1️⃣0️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 9/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-9-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 9/100days"/><published>2025-02-25T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-9-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-9-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day9️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-26_00-12-52.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-25-iter-x-9-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-26_00-13-06.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Itinerary Page Design </div> <p>Today, things are finally starting to move.

Now, when reading about the experiences of individuals or companies, it’s no longer just a story to me; I can now really understand how decisions made at each stage of a company’s development have a profound impact on its future.</p> <p>Nvidia’s growth over the past thirty years, from making graphics cards to launching GPUs, competing with Intel’s CPUs, repeatedly overtaking competitors, the birth of CUDA, and now the leap into AI — after reading, it’s clear that many pivotal moments weren’t just luck, but the result of accumulated knowledge and decisions made along the way.</p> <p>I’ve posted three excerpts from the book’s appendix regarding Jensen Huang’s leadership style. Personally, I think Nvidia has a few standout characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Aggressive Talent Acquisition: Jensen Huang and the executive team are very aggressive in hiring top talent. Many times, they would identify the core people in a team or company and directly approach them to join Nvidia. While other companies may have just two key architects, Nvidia has hundreds. With a large pool of talented people, excellent individuals naturally want to be around other excellent people.</li> <li>Heavy Investment in R&amp;D: Nvidia has always been generous in investing in research. They spend a lot of money on research and hire top talent from elite universities. Once researchers make significant breakthroughs or PoCs, Nvidia would immediately invest in R&amp;D, transitioning the researchers to the R&amp;D team. The continuous investment in CUDA, even when it was against Wall Street’s short-term interests, is a bold decision. It’s impressive to see how they’ve been able to withstand short-term pressure for long-term gains.</li> <li>Employee Incentives: The company offers stock options with a four-year vesting period, and for those who perform exceptionally well, stock options are extended for another four years. If someone produces outstanding results, additional stock options are allocated. Huang also has the authority to grant stock options to individuals directly.</li> <li>High-Pressure, High-Intensity Work Culture: This comes from Huang’s own workaholic nature, which has shaped the company culture. It’s not uncommon for employees to work 12-hour days. For example, they would break conventional cycles of graphics card releases and push new products to market every year or even every six months, which was so fast that competitors couldn’t keep up, eventually driving them out of business.</li> <li>Flat Organizational Structure: Nvidia avoids a pyramid-like structure. Huang’s executive team is at the top, followed by employees. Huang often casually chats with employees, making it clear that everyone knows his thoughts and the company’s strategic direction. One of the most impressive things is that Huang requires everyone to send him a “Top 5” list every day, allowing him to gauge the market situation directly from both frontline and non-frontline staff. He can sense changes in the market through these reports and make decisions accordingly. For over thirty years, Huang has refused to have a private office.</li> <li>Whiteboard Culture: They avoid using PowerPoint presentations for internal purposes. Huang believes that PowerPoint is for external audiences and makes the company look polished. Internally, they use whiteboards, where teams write and discuss ideas openly. This forces management to have a clear understanding of the current, past, and future situations without relying on fancy charts and graphs to gloss over things.

By the way, I haven’t introduced it yet—Iter-X. “Iter” is a Latin word meaning journey or path, and “X” gives it a modern and technological feel. It’s also a way to avoid issues with registering a single word or conflicts with others. As for the Chinese name, I haven’t figured it out yet. I considered “易途” (Yi Tu), which fits both in terms of pronunciation and meaning, but it feels a bit too common or plain, lacking a trendy vibe. So, I’ve hit a dead end with that. I’ve even thought about not having a Chinese name at all.

They have a team of only 13 people, with just one frontend developer, and they use a shared codebase across all platforms. To put things into perspective, their service currently has<a href="https://bsky-users.theo.io/"><strong>31,951,353</strong></a>users (with an average of 0.6 new users every second). Their valuation is around $700 million.</p> <p>The age of LLMs has changed a lot, and the first group to be swept up in it was developers. Now, most developers are using AI-assisted development tools in their workflows, which has helped improve efficiency and expand their capabilities. Many examples in the industry show that small teams have experienced a massive increase in efficiency. This is great news, but there’s also some bad news 😟.</p> <p>Data shows that job opportunities for developers are sharply declining. Let’s look at the data from FRED (a source for U.S. and global economic data):</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/FRED1.2025-02-21_10-41-19-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/FRED1.2025-02-21_10-41-19-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/FRED1.2025-02-21_10-41-19-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/FRED1.2025-02-21_10-41-19.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Software Developer Job Openings </div> <p>Based on data from Indeed (a job search site), software developer job openings in the U.S. had been rising post-pandemic (when interest rates were near zero), but after May 2022, they started to decline and have remained low since.</p> <p>Now, many companies, including Big Tech, are cutting headcounts (even laying off employees).

Overall job openings have stayed relatively steady, and their decline is less sharp. However, if we focus on the area where they intersect, it shows that job openings were more abundant earlier, and now, the decrease is just catching up, which could level out over time.</p> <p>However, there is some bias in the data, as it’s based on Indeed, similar to how a report on employment data from Boss Zhipin only reflects its platform’s data and may not fully represent the broader environment. Especially in AI-focused startups, there’s a good chance they’re not covered, but the trend is still noticeable.</p> <p>I wonder what kind of major changes we will see in the next few years. Individuals and companies are always influenced by forces beyond their control. All we can do is improve ourselves, make ourselves stronger, and keep up with the times to avoid being left behind and discarded by the market. That’s all we can do. Looking back, the rise of startups might also be because each generation has people growing up in this environment, who understand what this generation needs and, with the right cross-disciplinary skills and timing, come up with new ideas.</p> <p>I had 1v1 chats with several people today, including entrepreneurs from my industry and product managers. We exchanged ideas, and I could feel the thoughts behind some of the products from their creators. Some of them already have products out, and you can see their ideas and intentions in them. It’s pretty nice. Talking with competitors can feel a little weird, though, haha. Many people mentioned the concept of “moats” or “barriers to entry,” and I think that makes sense and aligns with intuition—there will always be someone entering the field. However, I remain optimistic. The competitive nature of the market itself shows potential. As for the travel industry, its market size depends on the depth of the field. Currently, most profits are coming from OTAs like Ctrip. It will depend on the vision and skill of each founder. Great products and the right business models will make a difference. But not every business is aimed at the large market; some small, beautiful products and teams are what many people pursue nowadays. Looking forward to learning from more experts 😎.</p> <p>Back to the main point, I worked on part of the main trip page today. It’s still rough and needs more polishing. I really like two color schemes: one with a cool-toned palette that feels calming, and one with contrasting color blocks that gives off a cool vibe. I’m thinking of letting users switch between themes.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-22_00-36-46-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-22_00-36-46-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-22_00-36-46-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign1.2025-02-22_00-36-46.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-22_00-36-52-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-22_00-36-52-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-22_00-36-52-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-21-iter-x-5-100/TripPageDesign2.2025-02-22_00-36-52.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Page Design </div> <p>Here’s a summary of the current situation:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design: 4%, ideas are coming together, currently working with 2️⃣</li> <li>UI/UX Design: 4%, it’s in progress</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 10%, currently paused, need to focus on 2️⃣ and 4️⃣ first</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 0%, waiting for 1️⃣ &amp; 2️⃣ to be completed</li> </ol> <p>In the next few days, I’ll be focusing on 1️⃣ and 2️⃣.</p> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persist</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Interested in this field</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 4/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-4-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 4/100days"/><published>2025-02-20T14:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-20T14:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-4-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-4-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4️⃣</p> <p>Off-topic: Today I came across the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funemployed</code>, and I found it quite interesting.

I hope the team can kick me if they see this, just to let me know.</p> <p>On RedNote, when searching for travel planning apps, I mostly saw Round Trip Tracks, and it truly lives up to expectations. It’s the best app among these, in my opinion (waiting for mine to come out 🙇🏾‍♂️). It’s smooth, with very few lags, and many operations are aligned with my ideas for my app. The only drawback is incomplete point-of-interest data and less powerful AI. If they focus on these areas, it could improve even more. Feel free to reach out to me, the wild player, for a chat 🧑🏿‍💻.</p> <p>I found Guide Travel through RedNote ads.

I didn’t have time to check the latest news, so I just listened to the ALL-IN Podcast during my commute. I wasn’t feeling great and intended to rest early, but I ended up staying up past midnight 😪. The past few days, my side projects have been pretty busy, so it’s hard to find time for everything.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%201-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%201-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%201-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%201.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%202-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%202-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%202-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/The%20Nvidia%20Way%202.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> The Nvidia Way </div> <p>I’ve been trying to squeeze in some time to read The Nvidia Way. I’ve only got the last two sections left. Today I read about how Jensen Huang is a workaholic, and how the entire company’s atmosphere is high-pressure and intense. I feel a bit conflicted about this.</p> <p>From an entrepreneurial or career perspective, it’s understandable that the founder is like this, and it could even increase the chances of success. I can relate deeply because I’m also a workaholic. But at the same time, as one of the many regular office workers, I can’t help but wonder if such “great” companies are really the end goal for employees.</p> <p>I really value work-life balance. It’s not that I don’t want to work, but I think people should have space outside of work, whether it’s for family, solitude, or anything else they enjoy. All three words in “work-life balance” are important.</p> <p>So, I feel conflicted about it. When reading that part, I guess I’m thinking from two different angles. If I look at it from one side only, I might feel strongly and defend my viewpoint. Maybe if my desire to start a business fades, I’ll start defending work-life balance more. Or if I succeed as an entrepreneur and become a boss, I might feel that not being aggressive and seizing market opportunities is a problem. But perhaps it’s not a simple black-and-white issue—there’s information asymmetry and trade-offs that come with decisions, and it’s hard to summarize in one sentence. Thinking dialectically helps you reflect on things. What’s important isn’t coming to a conclusion but the process of thinking 🐨.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/BSing2025-02-19_23-19-01-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/BSing2025-02-19_23-19-01-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/BSing2025-02-19_23-19-01-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/BSing2025-02-19_23-19-01.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/Prototype.2025-02-19_23-52-00-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/Prototype.2025-02-19_23-52-00-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/Prototype.2025-02-19_23-52-00-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-02-19-iter-x-3-100/Prototype.2025-02-19_23-52-00.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Prototype &amp; BSing </div> <p>Today, I still managed to make some progress on my project.
