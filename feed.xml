Besides building my own product, I’m also actively following the latest trends and what’s currently hot in the space. Lately, there’s no doubt MCP has been the breakout star. Even non-technical founders are FOMOing hard.</p> <p>That said, I personally don’t think MCP is particularly technically challenging — that’s one point. Another is that, for most companies, it currently doesn’t have direct commercial value. However, it does carry some auxiliary value. For cloud providers in particular, MCP could offer strategic value, especially in driving sales of other products like compute resources. While it’s still a toB business for now, no one wants to be left behind in the FOMO wave.</p> <p>I’m exploring directions where this could potentially generate real value. Even though I’m still full-steam ahead on building Iter-X, I don’t believe success comes from just one product or project. I believe continuous learning, hands-on practice, consistent output, and a cycle of accumulation and innovation will increase the chances of achieving success in the long run.</p> <p>If you’re interested in this space, let’s chat.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data Layer: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you check these boxes, let’s connect:</p> <ol> <li>You can persist.</li> <li>You have a dream.</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣8️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 57/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 57/100days"/><published>2025-04-14T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-14T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-57-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣7️⃣</p> <p>I’m still fine-tuning the details—haha—I want the experience to be smooth as silk. This DragNDrop feature isn’t done yet, and I just can’t leave it unfinished. I’m almost there, just need to perfect a few small details.</p> <p>Actually, I wanted to talk a bit about being an indie developer or a solopreneur. I think a lot of people nowadays have this idea of creating something interesting, or maybe earning a bit of income on the side. It’s a good thing. Let me share my thoughts from Day 0️⃣ until now—nearly two months in. I’ve collaborated with others in the past on projects that required long-term, intense commitment, though not every day required syncing up or summarizing progress. But this time, it feels different. It’s more like starting a business—working around the clock. While it’s not the same as the carefree approach of my younger days, it’s still quite close to that feeling.</p> <p>So, if you’re thinking about starting something, I’d say go for a 100-Day Build in Public challenge. Of course, it doesn’t have to be public—you could do it for yourself. But using a 100-day timeframe to test yourself can be really enlightening. It lets you measure your resilience, test your ideas, and help you understand whether this path—a path that’s more likely to fail than succeed—is truly right for you. There are some things that aren’t suitable for sharing in public spaces. I have a lot of important reflections that I think shouldn’t be discussed here, as the implications might not be appropriate. After 100 days, I may look for opportunities to talk more about the people, events, experiences, and thoughts from this journey.</p> <p>After pausing to reflect, it’s time to move forward. To the solitary travelers out there, I hope that, in the many journeys you take in this lifetime, there will always be something that drives you onward and inspires you to keep exploring the endless unknown.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 58%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 48%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Vision</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣7️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 56/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 56/100days"/><published>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-13T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-56-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣6️⃣</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder if striving for perfection and obsessing over details is actually a bad thing.

On the itinerary page, the initial idea was to show a compact layout listing the POIs for each day, and then allow users to tap into a more detailed view—also organized by day. But today while implementing it, I noticed these two aren’t actually in a sequential relationship; they’re more like parallel representations—just different ways of displaying the same data. So I ended up separating them and adding a toggle. By default, it now enters the detailed view, but users can switch to the simplified one (though I’m starting to question if the simplified version is even necessary).</p> <p>Designing really isn’t easy to get perfectly right—maybe it’s my half-baked skills, but many finer details just get overlooked in the design phase until you actually start building.</p> <p>Today I discovered a pretty useful UI prompt generator. Comparing results, I found that many poor generations in the past were just due to poorly written or vague prompts. With this kind of tool, it’s actually quite efficient to explore design ideas quickly. I even feel that not every screen needs a full high-fidelity mockup now. I’m leaning toward describing some screens in natural language, generating a prompt, and turning that into a UI layout expressed in React code. After a few rounds of “pulling cards” (i.e., prompt attempts), if I get a decent result, I’ll just use Cursor to turn it into Flutter code and tweak it slightly. It saves a lot of time compared to mindlessly grinding through Figma. Of course, for critical pages, it’s still better to draw them out to avoid big changes during implementation.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 55%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 45%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stick with it</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣5️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 54/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 54/100days"/><published>2025-04-11T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-11T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-54-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day5️⃣4️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-11-iter-x-54-100/ChatGPT-Memory.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> ChatGPT Memory </div> <p>The highlight of today was definitely ChatGPT giving a description of me based on our previous conversations (although I doubt it looked back as far as the past year or two). It actually moved me a little — for a moment, it felt like it had a soul. I talk to Sam (that’s what I call ChatGPT [insert doge emoji]) every single day — whether it’s typing or using voice to practice spoken English. I used to feel like each session was new and disconnected, without continuity or memory. And the old memory system? It was so limited that once it got full, you’d be told to delete entries yourself (basically erasing its memory). It was even worse than something like LRU — imagine asking users to manually delete memory. The result? Either wipe everything or leave it all untouched.</p> <p>But today, seeing how it summarized me based on our recent chats — even if it was trying to be catchy — really struck a chord. It brought back so many moments when I had shared ideas with it. Such a surreal feeling. Shoutout!</p> <p>As for the underlying tech, I suspect it might be an optimized combination of indexing and search, but I haven’t seen any detailed technical documentation about it yet. I want to dive into this area — something like Enhanced Memory. I believe this could be a key enabler for expanding the real-world applications of LLMs and generative AI. It’s definitely a field worth investing research efforts in. If you’re someone who’s into the cutting-edge work, academic or practical, in this space — I’d love to chat and learn more from you.</p> <p>Another week flew by! The visible progress on the product side wasn’t quite up to my expectations, but a lot of the invisible foundations did move forward. I hope to get the itinerary editing — from the main plan down to the daily details — done over the weekend.</p> <p>Also, I’m planning to start a fitness routine: a two-day cycle with 30 minutes reserved for exercise each day. That means I’ll need to boost efficiency and streamline my workflow even more — reduce distractions and increase output.</p> <p>Current progress overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 55%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 42%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you resonate with any of the following, let’s talk:</p> <ol> <li>You can commit consistently</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 53/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-53-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 53/100days"/><published>2025-04-10T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-10T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-53-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-53-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣3️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-10-iter-x-53-100/rednote-mcp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> RedNote-MCP </div> <p>Today I spent some time building a RedNote mcp-server using Playwright. It can later be used by agents to fetch note content. Cursor is truly a lifesaver — I even used playwright-mcp to let it navigate pages, extract content, and write code all on its own. Sometimes I just copy an element in the browser and paste it, and it writes the selector automatically. Thinking back to the pre-AI days of using Selenium or Playwright manually was a nightmare — not only did you have to locate elements yourself, but you also had to test thoroughly to make sure everything worked. In this aspect, I really respect AI.</p> <p>When it comes to AI browsing and scraping web content, besides the typical element-based methods like Playwright, here are the common approaches:</p> <p>1️⃣ Directly fetching via URL — this is the easiest to get blocked by anti-scraping systems, since many websites now detect abnormal user behavior.</p> <p>2️⃣ Simulating real user behavior via headless browsers — this is the approach I used earlier. It’s reliable in certain ways and relatively low cost. The downside is that if the page structure or elements change, you need to update your logic.</p> <p>3️⃣ Browser-use powered by vision + LLMs — this is the latest approach. By injecting JS to label interactive elements on the page, LLMs use multimodal reasoning to decide their next move. The biggest pro: it barely requires any manual adjustment, closely mimicking human behavior. The con: it’s expensive.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 53%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 42%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, let’s talk:</p> <ol> <li>Can stay committed</li> <li>Have a dream</li> <li>Interested and passionate</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣3️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 52/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-52-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 52/100days"/><published>2025-04-09T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-09T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-52-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-52-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day5️⃣2️⃣</p> <p>We had an online meeting today to discuss the logic behind data cleaning. The scale of the collected POI (Points of Interest) data is quite large. A complete POI includes basic information such as name, description, address, and coordinates, as well as some value-added information like recommended duration of visit, rating, etc. Some of this data can be collected at scale from public datasets, while the rest needs to be supplemented through other means:</p> <p>1️⃣ Due to the volume, manual work is out of the question initially (although it’s worth noting that manual input can be a viable method—especially at full user scale, users themselves act as data curators, which is the approach many mature platforms take. User-maintained data is often the most accurate).</p> <p>2️⃣ The conventional approach is using web crawlers to gather data from various sources. Some platforms provide this type of data.</p> <p>3️⃣ Nowadays, a lot of this can actually be done with LLMs. We’ve estimated that supplementing one POI consumes roughly 1,000 tokens, so even at the scale of hundreds of thousands of POIs, the cost remains quite low.</p> <p>There’s a lot of nuance in this process, but for now, we’re focusing on the MVP. Optimization can come later.</p> <p>Today, we finally integrated all the Agents, Tools, and Prompts into the database. This will make it easier to manage and switch between different versions. Next, we’ll build a simple admin dashboard for easy management and prompt tuning. We also plan to create a Trajectory Visualization interface for visualizing the Agent call chains, which will make debugging and tracking much more convenient.</p> <p>Current Progress Overview:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 50%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 42%</li> <li>Data: 12%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you match the following, we’d love to talk:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5️⃣2️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 51/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-51-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 51/100days"/><published>2025-04-08T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-08T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-51-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-51-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day5️⃣1️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-08-iter-x-51-100/FigPal3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> FigPal </div> <p>The best part today is FigPal, haha, it’s so cute. It’s a limited-time feature launched by Figma for April Fools’ Day. It’s really a completely useless but fun feature… I really like this kind of nonsense and quirky stuff; it doesn’t have any commercial value, but it’s very helpful for the brand’s tone.</p> <p>Today, I fine-tuned the AI process, and now it’s stable and reliable. It can consistently output itineraries, which I’m very satisfied with. I’m still using the previous pseudo-ToolUse idea, where the AI calls a non-existent tool, create_trip, just to get its stable JSON output. Today, I also discussed some benchmarks and personalization aspects with the AI team, and we’re on the same page. Many of our ideas align well, and in the next few days, I’ll be organizing and setting up a complete set of personalization standards. From our perspective, personalization is divided into two levels:</p> <p>1️⃣ User-level personalization</p> <p>2️⃣ Itinerary-level personalization</p> <p>For example, basic preferences like departure city, return city, departure time, budget, group size, and number of days are all part of the basic preferences. Then there are deeper preferences, like whether you’re more into cityscapes or nature, or whether you prefer a fast-paced trip or a more relaxed one. This hierarchy of preferences, from shallow to deep, can be used with AI to create the most effective itinerary planning assistance. Coming back to the above, user-level preferences are default and can cover all itineraries, but if there are different preferences within the itinerary, they take higher priority and will override the user-level preferences. This makes sense because each trip might be different, whether it’s due to your mood, personal experiences, the people you’re traveling with, the time of year, or the destination. Therefore, this hierarchical structure will be more accurate.</p> <p>Back to user preferences + AI-powered planning, I think there are two main issues in the market right now:</p> <p>1️⃣ The product is not well-done: Many products just mindlessly add AI, but in my opinion, effective planning is far more important than mindless intelligence. I’d rather have AI help once at a critical moment than have the user retry the planning 10 times. AI should have the authority to refuse planning when there’s insufficient information or downgrade to a conservative planning approach—one that works for most users and doesn’t make mistakes. This depends on how well the AI is trained and how well it collaborates with the context.</p> <p>2️⃣ Users have overly high expectations: A lot of people have this problem. AI knows a lot about the world, but it’s not a god. If you ask a regular friend, “I want to travel to Italy for 7 days, help me plan,” do you think their plan will meet all your preferences in one go? Maybe a close friend or family member can do this, but that’s because they have enough understanding of your preferences. So I think it’s important to manage users’ expectations. Otherwise, there’s a risk of overpromising and underdelivering. This is something that all AI product managers should be aware of. Personally, I have some ideas on this. AI can start small, letting users see how it can help in specific situations, and once they develop a basic understanding of its capabilities, the AI can expand to cover more scenarios. This approach is much better than presenting a complete product on a PPT, which might give users high expectations, only for them to experience disappointment when the real product falls short.</p> <p>Lastly, I want to say, if you’re feeling mentally and physically exhausted, don’t push yourself too hard. Take a break to release stress and regain balance. After that, you can jump back in. A long battle won’t be ruined by one or two days, and managing your state is key. When you’re in a good state, your efficiency is higher, and you’ll be more optimistic—otherwise, it’s the opposite.</p> <p>Summary of current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype design &amp; UI/UX design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 45%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) development: 40%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Dreams</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day5️⃣1️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 50/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-50-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 50/100days"/><published>2025-04-07T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-07T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-50-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-50-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 5️⃣0️⃣</p> <p>The day has finally come — we’ve reached the halfway point. Looking back, 100 days initially felt like they would pass in the blink of an eye. But once the countdown began, I realized how long it truly is. After all, 100 days is almost one-third of a year — basically, an entire quarter. And what you can accomplish in a quarter depends entirely on your mindset.</p> <p>The past couple of days, I’ve been feeling a bit off physically — a little tired, haha. Time to adjust and recharge so I can maintain high energy and efficiency. The road is long and the mountains are high, but I’ll keep moving with my heart.</p> <p>Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 42%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 35%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you believe you match the following qualities, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5️⃣0️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 49/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-49-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 49/100days"/><published>2025-04-06T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-06T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-49-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-49-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 4️⃣9️⃣</p> <p>Today was insanely busy—I even drove a round trip of 70 kilometers, which took four hours in total. Super packed. A friend also came by to chat about some interesting things, and I really appreciated that. I’m always open to talking with different people. Even though I only have 24 hours in a day, my efficiency and stress tolerance allow me to accomplish a lot—probably more than most people can handle. I’m also very confident that within my capabilities, I can bring different kinds of value to different people.</p> <p>I’ve said this before: more and more people are realizing that the path forward isn’t linear—especially when it comes to career growth. Increasingly, people are seeking nonlinear breakthroughs and returns. I have some of my own experiences and advice to share:</p> <p>1️⃣ First and foremost, you need to build your personal image. Maybe you’re someone great at design, or you’re skilled at building brand identity, or you’re a top-tier tech person. Whatever it is, you need to establish a “persona” for yourself. Of course, this needs to be backed by real skills—otherwise, it’s just a house of cards. Once you start collaborating with others, there’s no room for bluffing.</p> <p>2️⃣ Secondly, don’t act solely out of self-interest. Collaborate with different people and create things together. Through repeated collaboration, you’ll learn more about who you are, meet diverse people, and gradually understand what role you play in a team and what kind of value you bring to the table.</p> <p>3️⃣ Lastly, never stop learning. Strong self-confidence always comes from strong capabilities—or at least strong learning ability. Always stay grounded and confident, ready to take on all the known and unknown challenges ahead.</p> <p>Haha, maybe this is getting a bit lofty and preachy—but hey, it’s all in good fun. I never encourage people to slack off, only to hustle hard. 🤯</p> <p>Current progress update:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 40%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 33%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you match the following, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>You can stick with it</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You’re genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 4️⃣9️⃣]]></summary></entry></feed>
