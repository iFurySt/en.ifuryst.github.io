I admit I‚Äôve also been ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù by 4.0, and I believe there are still many aspects where 4.0 cannot match the solutions like ComfyUI + SD. However, I think in most scenarios, it‚Äôs the best solution because the barrier to entry is so low. Many people overlook this point, which is incredibly important for a product to reach regular users. It‚Äôs crucial to discard the mindset of ‚Äúthis is nothing, *** could already do this‚Äù and let go of arrogance and self-righteousness. We need to deeply understand and think about the market and people‚Äôs reactions. A product doesn‚Äôt need to pursue the most cutting-edge technology to achieve great success. Countless companies and products in history have proven this. We can reflect on why so many people are celebrating, why the design community is panicking and upset, and why OpenAI‚Äôs servers are once again unable to handle the pressure. There are profound reasons behind all of this.</p> <p>Riding the wave of this momentum, let me share my thoughts on future startup teams. I think I‚Äôve briefly mentioned this before. I believe future teams will be small and agile, only needing a few key roles:</p> <ol> <li>R&amp;D Personnel: If someone says that a person without any research background can replace this role, I strongly disagree. While Vibe Programming exists, it cannot replace everything. Of course, you can raise funds and hire people once your MVP is out, but fundamentally, you still need someone highly effective in terms of cognition and R&amp;D. Personally, I can now develop several features in half a day, which I would never have imagined before. It used to take me 1 hour to code a feature by hand, but reviewing and making small adjustments now only takes around 10 minutes. The difference in productivity is evident.</li> <li>Product: Excellent product design is something AI cannot fully replace at the moment. It might be a chemical reaction from the subjective irrationality of carbon-based life forms interacting with the real world, including some industry experience. I believe a good idea and a good product direction are the foundation of success. It‚Äôs true that anyone can be a product manager, but many products are also just mediocre.</li> <li>Designer: Design is absolutely necessary. AI can do many things, but not everything can be covered by AI. It‚Äôs best to have your own unique style and empower it with AI. I actually think design is becoming an even more important role in the future. Although many people worry about being replaced by AI, I see this as a trend, just like how AI may eventually replace R&amp;D personnel. However, there are higher-level elements that human designers can offer, which act as their moat.</li> <li>Operations: A product requires ongoing operations. A key point in operations is having a style and knowing various operational strategies. We can let AI help with operational materials, but the actual implementation still needs people with sufficient cognition and experience.</li> <li>Business Growth: This is a crucial area. AI can‚Äôt help you with business, at most it can help you write a business plan, but it can‚Äôt help you find investors, pitch your ideas, or think about business growth based on actual situations. In fact, I think business is one of the areas where AI currently has the least impact.</li> </ol> <p>Perhaps in the future, teams will only need five ‚Äúsuperheroes.‚Äù If you find that the people in your team can‚Äôt use AI, you might want to be cautious. Of course, I don‚Äôt oppose Old School; I think it can be a form of sentiment ‚ù§Ô∏è</p> <p>I still like my key point: AI can‚Äôt help you stay persistent, it can‚Äôt help you always stay motivated. The only thing that can stop you from moving forward is your heart and your comfy sofa üòá</p> <p>Summary of current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 39%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) Progress: 30%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can persist</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Is interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 46/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-46-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 46/100days"/><published>2025-04-03T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-03T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-46-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-46-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>I‚Äôve adjusted the AI again. I‚Äôm planning to use Function Call‚Äôs JSON return to achieve a stable structured JSON output. Essentially, I‚Äôm tricking the AI by using a tool that doesn‚Äôt actually exist or need execution. Normally, we rely on prompts to request a JSON response, but that approach doesn‚Äôt seem to guarantee 100% stability.</p> <p>I‚Äôve also further broken down the agents into more atomic units. Now, each agent handles a very specific task, making it easier to reuse their functions. For example, I‚Äôve separated CityPlanner and TripPlanner, so if the destination city is unknown, AI can first plan the cities before diving into the itinerary. Over the next couple of days, I‚Äôll focus on connecting the entire itinerary module, which will bring the core functionality to life.</p> <p>It‚Äôs hard to believe that nearly half of the 100-day journey has passed. The intensity of daily output is quite demanding, especially since some days don‚Äôt show obvious progress. The public is mostly visual-oriented, and I don‚Äôt want to dig into too many technical details because that would be even more tedious. Instead, I mix in insights and news occasionally. If I build in public again in the future, I might consider sharing in phases rather than posting daily updates. I don‚Äôt want the content to become a monotonous log‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather deliver it when there‚Äôs something valuable to share.</p> <p>Current Progress: ‚Ä¢ Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33% ‚Ä¢ Backend (Go) Development: 36% ‚Ä¢ Client (Flutter) Development: 25% ‚Ä¢ Data: 10%</p> <p>If you meet the following criteria, let‚Äôs connect:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Ambitious</li> <li>Passionate</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 45/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-45-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 45/100days"/><published>2025-04-02T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-02T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-45-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-45-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MainTripPage2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePageSkeleton.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-02-iter-x-45-100/MinePage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Main Trip Page &amp; Mine Page </div> <p>Still working on the pages. I plan to integrate the itinerary this week and check if I‚Äôm going anywhere for the Qingming Festival. If not, I should be able to finish it. The progress has been good these past two days. I will reassess the overall progress next week. These tasks are being pushed forward based on my intuition, not following a strict timeline, which I think is one of the challenges in project management. If there was a clear roadmap and the requirements were well-defined, progress could be more predictable and manageable. Otherwise, it‚Äôs difficult to smoothly advance the project. Right now, we‚Äôre still in a chaotic state, and everything is growing wildly, which is a significant issue. However, we could consider introducing a simple visual dashboard to track our MVP progress. But because the collaboration is quite loose, it‚Äôs challenging to bring in project management tools commonly used in the industry. This is a bit of a paradox, and I‚Äôll need to think about and learn more about it. The goal is not to add unnecessary complexity, but to make sure everyone on the team clearly understands the current project status‚Äîwhere the bottlenecks are, where they stand, and what others are working on. These insights would be meaningful.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the current summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 34%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter) progress: 23%</li> <li>Data: 10%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI designer üëæ):</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dreamer</li> <li>Interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 44/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-44-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 44/100days"/><published>2025-04-01T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-44-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-44-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-04-01-iter-x-44-100/cursor.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> POI </div> <p>Today, we made significant progress with our POI data.

There are some tasks I can automate using n8n, which will help improve my efficiency and productivity. I think investing time in this is worthwhile. For example, I can quickly push articles I‚Äôve written to different platforms through some custom nodes and workflows. Another thing is information aggregation and dimensionality reduction. I‚Äôve been consuming a lot of information daily, and I need to aggregate it to reduce redundant news. This way, I can allocate more time to reading in-depth articles. Having a broad yet precise strategy allows me to stay on top of the latest trends while also exploring interesting ideas.

They expect to generate $200 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) through subscriptions over the next 12 months. They‚Äôre currently raising a new round of funding, and their valuation is expected to reach $10 billion. This company currently has only 50 employees, which is impressive. Their success is largely due to early popularity within developer circles and winning Product Hunt‚Äôs 2024 Product of the Year award. Since then, they‚Äôve continued to gain popularity. Their net revenue retention rate (NRR) for March 2024 reached an astounding 250%. What does this mean? It indicates that their existing customers are not only continuing to pay but are also paying more‚Äî$1 per customer is now $2.50. A typical NRR of 115% is already considered excellent, as it signifies steady revenue growth from existing customers. So, Cursor‚Äôs NRR is truly remarkable. Personally, I‚Äôm not surprised at all. I think Cursor has surpassed traditional IDEs and has become the new standard. JetBrains products seem to have stagnated. Recently, I‚Äôve been using it extensively for creating SOP manuals and training documents for my team to refer to before starting new tasks. The results have been incredible. One of my team members, whom I introduced to it, couldn‚Äôt stop praising it and spent the entire day watching AI-related content. I‚Äôll share more on this topic later. If you‚Äôre still in the camp of not using it or criticizing it as hard to use, I urge you to reconsider. I believe you‚Äôll soon realize that others are moving ahead, and if you think it‚Äôs hard to use, try to see if you‚Äôre using it incorrectly or misjudging the AI‚Äôs capabilities, leading to incorrect results.

This is understandable; at the beginning, there are a lot of things to handle. After completing a few pages or APIs, many things can be reused, so the speed naturally picks up.</p> <p>Today, I was looking into Bluesky‚Äôs ATProtocol. Although I had seen it before, I hadn‚Äôt carefully examined its technical architecture. After reading an article analyzing it, I started thinking about whether a decentralized blockchain social platform could become the next big trend. After all, the Web3 buzz has been going on for quite a while. But on second thought, our travel app could also explore this direction. Although it feels a bit like a tech utopia, if the app doesn‚Äôt really take off in the future, I would consider fully open-sourcing it and integrating ATProtocol or creating a custom decentralized travel protocol. In this case, the app would simply be an AppView, a display carrier, and the data would be mostly consensus-based on the blockchain. Users would own their own data, which could be a fun and innovative concept.</p> <p>Last night, I recorded a screen capture of the current client situation. After doing a bit of hands-on work, I‚Äôm starting to get a feel for it. I look forward to recording another screen capture this week to share. Over the past few days, I‚Äôve been receiving messages from new friends who are sharing or asking about features in the app. I‚Äôm happy to continuously receive private messages, and we actively consider many great suggestions.

If I can keep up this speed, it won‚Äôt be long before I can finish the remaining pages. Over the next couple of days, I‚Äôll need to supplement the backend interfaces. Since I stopped drawing every day, the progress has really picked up! It‚Äôs important to balance things out. For anyone considering independent development, there are a few things we need to handle for an app:</p> <ol> <li>Setting up the code structure and basic framework (this is crucial, but if you have experience with past projects, it‚Äôs usually quick).</li> <li>Product brainstorming ‚Äî those with capability will output mind maps and wireframes.</li> <li>Design work (depending on the size of the product, this can go quickly or slowly, but it‚Äôs a significant task).</li> <li>Database design (for more complex products, this is a major job, but I usually produce this along with backend development).</li> <li>Backend development (its importance depends on the product‚Äôs target scale).</li> <li>Frontend/client-side development (end users are visual beings, while B2B is more function-driven).</li> <li>Integration and testing, reviewing design implementation (details always take up a lot of time and energy, depending on the scale and whether you‚Äôre a perfectionist).</li> </ol> <p>These are the main areas.

It‚Äôs clear that for independent developers, building a team to handle all these aspects requires a huge amount of effort üßëüèø‚Äçüíª.</p> <p>Summary of current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 32%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 19%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner üëæ):</p> <ol> <li>Can persevere</li> <li>Has dreams</li> <li>Is interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 41/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-41-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 41/100days"/><published>2025-03-29T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-29T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-41-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-41-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-29-iter-x-41-100/GitHubContributions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> GitHub Contributions </div> <p>Today, I was busy coding and really immersed in it. I was mainly working on the client side, and seeing the implementation on the real device was amazing. It felt just like transitioning from prototype to high-fidelity design, and it was very satisfying. There‚Äôs a creative sense to it, and as I‚Äôve said before, I really enjoy creating. I think it‚Äôs an important driving force that can support you for the long haul. I checked my main repository and saw there have been 179 commits. Since Day 0, February 17th, I‚Äôve been consistently pushing updates to GitHub. The fewest commits in a day was 2, and the most was 38. When you feel like you want to do something, build something, or even start a business, you need to ask yourself: can you keep going like this for months or even years? Why do I keep emphasizing the power of persistence? I don‚Äôt like it when people simplify everything with the phrase ‚Äúchoice is more important than effort‚Äù and use that to negate the value of hard work. If you look at most successful people, the majority are the result of hard work‚Äîthere‚Äôs no shortcut. Going back to the earlier question: knowing is easy, doing is hard. I hope that the fire inside of you keeps burning, and that you don‚Äôt let the dullness of the real world easily put it out.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 32%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter) progress: 18%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design teammate üëæ):</p> <ol> <li>Can persist</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Have an interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day4Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 40/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-40-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 40/100days"/><published>2025-03-28T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-28T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-40-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-40-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day4Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>At the invitation of KejiShu, I had an online chat with their operations team for nearly an hour today. We mainly conducted an interview focused on independent developers, shared some thoughts on the creative process, and discussed how there is now a wider variety of content on Xiaohongshu (XHS). They are also considering some future features. We even talked about the 18-image + 1K-word limit, which I think is a format that creators in certain fields inevitably encounter. However, this is closely tied to XHS‚Äôs product positioning, making it difficult to change.</p> <p>Overall, it was an enjoyable conversation. I love exchanging ideas with different people‚Äîmany times, these interactions spark new and interesting thoughts. I look forward to seeing them provide more support for independent developers in the future and hope they maintain the platform‚Äôs overall community atmosphere and tone. After all, this could be one of the key motivations for many people to continue creating.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/MinePage2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Mine Page </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/RawMinePage.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-28-iter-x-40-100/Cursor+Figma2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Cursor + Figma to codes </div> <p>Over the past two days, I explored two AI-powered efficiency improvements. The day before yesterday, I used Cursor with Figma to generate prototype images from text. Today, I experimented with using Cursor + Figma to convert design files into Flutter client code. I found the results and efficiency gains of the latter more significant.</p> <p>I‚Äôve attached some images‚Äîby using the simplest prompts and just two iterations, I generated a 60%-complete page. After spending some time refining it, I got the final version. I think this approach is something I‚Äôll continue experimenting with, as I aim to maximize my efficiency.</p> <p>Today, someone with their own product ideas joined our team and will help us focus on data preparation for POI recommendations. I‚Äôm happy to see talented people continuing to join us. Our two product teammates are also actively discussing ideas and defining features.</p> <p>One interesting aspect is that while our prototypes, design files, and development have all progressed to a certain extent, the complete product definition is still catching up. This is mainly because the product team joined later. Initially, I was the one conceptualizing everything, so now we‚Äôre running on two parallel tracks. However, I remain optimistic‚Äîmost functional elements shouldn‚Äôt deviate too much, and UI/UX refinements can be adjusted quickly with some additional effort but still within a manageable scope.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 32%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 32%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 17%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, we‚Äôd love to chat!

Everyone is making progress in their respective areas, and we‚Äôll push hard again this weekend. I also worked on the personal profile page a bit‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt the final version yet, just putting in some content for now, and we‚Äôll adjust the layout later.</p> <p>Today, I watched Lei Jun‚Äôs 2024 annual speech, and it resonated with me quite a bit. Overall, I have a lot of respect for him. While he‚Äôs undoubtedly a marketing genius, I still found some really genuine moments in his talk‚Äîespecially his approach to making cars. To truly understand the industry, he test-drove over 170 cars, borrowing them from friends, taking 4S store test drives, and even asking strangers in parking lots. He also led his team to obtain racing licenses, experiencing racing firsthand. Betting everything on one final startup, constantly learning and expanding his knowledge‚Äîthis level of dedication is something I deeply respect. It‚Äôs about truly loving what you do.</p> <p>He also mentioned a 21-day closed-door ‚Äúargument session‚Äù with his core team, where they debated until they fully understood the direction before executing.</p> <p>This is perhaps the mindset every entrepreneur should have‚Äîstripping away the unnecessary fluff and just focusing on getting things done. There‚Äôs no need for grand, empty slogans or overly complex processes. What matters is full commitment from everyone involved. Larger companies often suffer from bureaucracy, pushing employees to become hyper-specialized in their roles. But in a fast-moving team, we need people to be more versatile, aligning under a shared vision to build momentum.</p> <p>Having a deep understanding of what you‚Äôre working on is crucial. Just like with our product‚Äîwe need to first develop our own perspectives on travel before we can shape the product around those insights. Only then can we define our individual roles within this project.</p> <p>I also came across some great quotes about travel while reading a magazine today, but I forgot to take pictures. I‚Äôll jot them down tomorrow and share them!</p> <p>Current Progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 31%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 31%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 14%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>We‚Äôre Looking for a UI Designer üëæ!</p> <p>If you match the following, let‚Äôs talk:</p> <ol> <li>Commitment</li> <li>Dreams</li> <li>Passion &amp; Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day3Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry></feed>
