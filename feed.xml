Went out today and witnessed the sheer number of tourists ‚Äî it was absolutely packed. Despite that, I still managed to release two new versions. High-efficiency output!</p> <p>While I was out, I got inspired with a new idea: an insurance assistant. Right now, due to various reasons, the awareness and acceptance of insurance among many people in China is relatively low. There are several causes, but I believe one major reason is the resistance to salespeople and the headache of trying to understand complex insurance policies. The information gap also leads to major differences in perception. For example, today we encountered a question about whether a 70-year-old can still purchase critical illness insurance, and had to dig through specific policies to find the answer.</p> <p>So I thought ‚Äî what if we collect policy terms and product data from mainstream insurance companies, and use AI + RAG to build a digital insurance advisor? One that helps users quickly identify suitable products based on their needs, while explaining confusing terms in simple language. This would also help educate the market. From what I know, many insurance agents don‚Äôt have strong backgrounds ‚Äî even though that‚Äôs improving, overall professionalism remains uneven.</p> <p>This product could be offered for free, and monetized by partnering with insurance providers ‚Äî earning commissions when users make purchases through the platform. I think this idea has strong potential for commercialization. I haven‚Äôt done formal market research yet (there are probably several competitors already), but I still believe the idea has value. If I choose to pursue it, I‚Äôll likely start by building a version just for myself and close friends, then promote it organically in relevant communities. No monetization in the early phase ‚Äî just focusing on solving real user pain points. I believe that could lead to a solid user base.</p> <p>Have you ever tried an AI doctor that reads medical reports? I found it extremely helpful. In real life, many doctors don‚Äôt have the time or resources to give you thorough explanations. That‚Äôs why some patients become experts over time ‚Äî they‚Äôre forced to. AI doctors can fill this gap well. While they might err on the side of caution in diagnosis, they‚Äôre great for objective education and personalized health advice. You can ask them step-by-step about a new illness, understand its mechanisms, and learn how your habits might contribute to it. That allows you to take targeted action. I believe the same model could work brilliantly in other vertical domains, including insurance.</p> <p>Of course, building a good product is about removing what doesn‚Äôt work, but as a creator or entrepreneur, I think the mindset should be: first identify and amplify what works, then use your ability and resources to fix what doesn‚Äôt. Success might not be far from there. These are two different mindsets I often observe. I wonder ‚Äî which type are you? There‚Äôs no absolute right or wrong ‚Äî just a difference in what suits the path you‚Äôre on.</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stay committed</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Have passion</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 7Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 73/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-73-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 73/100days"/><published>2025-04-30T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-30T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-73-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-73-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 7Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Holiday mode has officially begun! My open-source project has hit 571 stars so far ‚Äî exactly 15 days since launch. Users are starting to integrate it and provide feedback, which I‚Äôm really happy about. I‚Äôve set the next milestone at 1k stars, at which point I‚Äôll start working on the Cloud Version, allowing people to configure and experience it directly in the browser. This stage will mostly be free to use.</p> <p>After that, I‚Äôll consider splitting out a commercial version. I haven‚Äôt thought too far ahead yet ‚Äî I‚Äôll decide once we hit the 1k milestone. The commercial edition is part of how I‚Äôm thinking about the project‚Äôs monetization. It‚Äôll likely include some features that are not in the open-source version. Balancing open-source and commercial offerings is tricky:</p> <ul> <li>If you open too much, the commercial version loses appeal.</li> <li>If you open too little, it hurts adoption and community engagement.</li> </ul> <p>This project has become a great case study in building efficiently in the AI era:</p> <ol> <li>Stay sensitive to gaps in the market</li> <li>Move fast ‚Äî build and release an MVP in a few days</li> <li>Launch within niche communities to get early feedback</li> <li>Iterate quickly based on real usage</li> </ol> <p>It‚Äôs a healthy product loop that fits the AI era perfectly.</p> <p>Looking back at Iter-X, I do feel it‚Äôs moving a bit slow ‚Äî though that‚Äôs partly because the to-C (consumer-facing) approach is fundamentally different and demands a higher baseline in terms of stability and design. Still, I‚Äôve learned so much this time around. For example, it‚Äôs hard enough to find a solid full-time co-founder ‚Äî finding reliable collaborators in the part-time pool is even more difficult. Analyzing it this way makes things more understandable.</p> <p>Honestly, building in public has been amazing ‚Äî it forces you to reflect and consolidate your thoughts. Even if the product I plan to launch on Day 100 doesn‚Äôt go live, I‚Äôll have gained a ton of experience and growth just by going through the process.</p> <p>By the way, I‚Äôm working on a new idea with a very clear revenue model (already validated in the market). I‚Äôm actively doing feasibility research during this holiday break. I might go the solopreneur route for this one. I‚Äôm not ready to share details just yet, but if you have strong hands-on experience and deep understanding of AI applications, feel free to reach out. If this idea works out, I‚Äôll need long-term collaborators focused on AI at the application layer.</p> <p>‚∏ª</p> <p>Current progress recap:</p> <ol> <li>UI/UX &amp; prototype design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you check these boxes, come talk to me:</p> <ol> <li>You can commit long-term</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You‚Äôre genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 7Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 72/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-72-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 72/100days"/><published>2025-04-29T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-29T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-72-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-72-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 7Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>The holidays are coming, and it‚Äôs time to get out and explore a bit. It‚Äôs been almost three months since I returned from the US for Chinese New Year, and I‚Äôve been working intensely ever since. Time to enjoy some good food and fun.</p> <p>I started this travel app 72 days ago because of my love for traveling‚Äînever forget why you started. That said, I really don‚Äôt enjoy crowded places; being stuck in a sea of people ruins the experience for me. That‚Äôs also why I especially love traveling abroad. I feel many people have the means to travel internationally, but in reality, only a small portion actually go‚Äîand even fewer do so consistently.</p> <p>I want to shape this app into a platform for recording life experiences. Right now, most of our memories are scattered across notes, photos, videos, social media posts, and, of course, our minds. But it made me wonder: how do people generally treat their memories? Some people revisit beautiful moments often, some always look ahead, and some fall somewhere in between. I‚Äôm in the middle‚ÄîI rarely scroll back through old photos or videos, but when I see something related, a memory fragment will resurface.</p> <p>Sorting through travel photos and related memories takes a lot of effort, and I believe AI can solve a significant part of that pain.</p> <p>Progress so far:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client-side (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you think you fit the following, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 7Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 71/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-71-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 71/100days"/><published>2025-04-28T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-28T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-71-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-71-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 7Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Today, an old friend joined to help with the data part. I didn‚Äôt expect that someone would join at the final stage of the 100D journey. In the next couple of days, I‚Äôll also review the data scripts written by other teammates. I did a quick test run today ‚Äî the results look OK, but I haven‚Äôt checked the code implementation yet. I‚Äôll work on integrating everything and set it up on the server to start generating some data.</p> <p>Recently, I‚Äôve realized that AI tools like Cursor are much stronger at writing React code than Flutter ‚Äî you can basically ‚Äúvibe code‚Äù effortlessly with React, but with Flutter, you still often need to manually fix things. I guess this is partly due to the difference in dataset sizes ‚Äî React (JS) has such a dominant share on GitHub that no other language can easily compete. It‚Äôs a bit frustrating. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if developing clients with React Native might be faster and smoother.

The Day 1 campaign will begin tomorrow, April 28th, at 3 PM Beijing time. I‚Äôm hoping to make a strong push for the charts! In just 12 days, I made 107 commits and released version v0.2.7. Before the era of generative AI, achieving something like this would have been almost unimaginable ‚Äî nearly impossible. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder of how fast the world is moving forward, and how individuals are swept along, willingly or not, running ever faster.</p> <p>As Dickens famously said, ‚ÄúIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî just like everything has two sides, it all depends on how you choose to look at it. Personally, I believe it‚Äôs the best of times ‚Äî an era that grants individuals unprecedented ‚Äúcapabilities‚Äù and acceleration.

One time he talked about how he manages to be so productive, and he mentioned that he once did 100 consecutive days of content creation. Combined with his years of writing experience, he can now quickly turn the information he absorbs into writing every day, maintaining a high-output state. This idea stuck with me, and that night, on a bit of an impulse, I decided to give it a try myself.</p> <p>The ‚Äúpower of 100‚Äù is real ‚Äî once you go through it, you truly experience all the ups and downs. I think it‚Äôs worth doing at least once. It‚Äôs like a burst of impulsive passion or impulse spending ‚Äî only through time and real experience can you grasp the real sweetness and bitterness of it.</p> <p>Although I‚Äôve always believed that frontend or client-side work is more visible ‚Äî easier to show results ‚Äî while backend work (especially in the early stages) often looks like simple CRUD operations until it reaches a certain scale, I‚Äôve realized that doing frontend or client development is actually incredibly demanding and often underappreciated. If you really want to pursue a perfect experience and polish the presentation, it requires a massive amount of time and energy. From my past experience, frontend and client-side work usually consumes a disproportionate amount of effort ‚Äî maybe because I‚Äôm not a seasoned frontend or mobile engineer.</p> <p>Now, with tools like Cursor + ChatGPT, many things are easier to cover, but the real challenge lies in continuous tuning and testing. Many times, you think you‚Äôve communicated your idea clearly, but the actual result can turn out quite different.</p> <p>Today, I finished polishing some basic add/delete functionalities. Even for a seemingly simple page, the information density is very high, and what it requires is built up layer by layer.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs a summary of my current progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend Development (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client-side Development (Flutter): 58%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel you fit the following, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Can stay consistent</li> <li>Have dreams</li> <li>Have passion and interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 6Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 68/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-68-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 68/100days"/><published>2025-04-25T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-25T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-68-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-68-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day6Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>As expected, having influential people with strong traffic help promote the project had a great impact, leading to a rapid boost. However, the key lies in choosing the right direction and track ‚Äî only then can others immediately recognize the quality of your project. Choosing the right track and then working hard is crucial.</p> <p>Speaking of which, Iter-X‚Äôs problem lies in its business model. Actually, I kind of want to ask Junyu Wang what he thinks about this [DOGE]. His project, ‚ÄúReading Room,‚Äù shows a similar shadow to what I‚Äôm experiencing. I don‚Äôt know how he thought through his product; I‚Äôve only seen glimpses of his journey through his articles. Somehow, I feel a one-sided resonance with him ‚Äî seeing a bit of myself in his experiences. Of course, it‚Äôs just a thought; I don‚Äôt really have a way to reach out to him.</p> <p>I feel that from these couple of days until after May 1st, my project progress might slow down significantly. In a way, the next month looks pretty unpredictable. I‚Äôve been considering whether I should shift to building a long-term cycle product. After nearly 100 days of high-intensity push ‚Äî almost a 007 (work-life blend) commitment to this side project ‚Äî I‚Äôm thinking about finding a better balance, especially since I‚Äôm not ‚Äúall-in‚Äù on a single project.</p> <p>Recently, I‚Äôve also had some new ideas about the product positioning. Perhaps this project can evolve toward the form of products like Devin or Manus, but with a strong focus on the travel field. It would allow for a gradual, progressive functional layering. Though this idea is not fully matured yet.</p> <p>I‚Äôll keep absorbing a large amount of information, working on entropy reduction, and see what might eventually come out of it. üôÇ</p> <p>‚∏ª</p> <p>Current Progress Summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend Development (Go): 60%</li> <li>Client Development (Flutter): 57%</li> <li>Data Preparation: 14%</li> </ol> <p>‚∏ª</p> <p>If you think you fit the following profile, feel free to reach out:</p> <ol> <li>Able to stay persistent</li> <li>Dream-driven</li> <li>Genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day6Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 67/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-67-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 67/100days"/><published>2025-04-24T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-24T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-67-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-67-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 6Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Marketing is crucial, especially in the early stage of a project. My two recent open-source projects both gained initial momentum by being shared in the right circles and platforms. They got in front of the right audience from day one. Then it‚Äôs all about expanding exposure‚Äîgetting your product or project seen in more places. Even if it doesn‚Äôt attract attention immediately, it can have a long-term effect. People will gradually trickle in. What you need to do is keep iterating.</p> <p>Even though these are just open-source projects, the approach is essentially a PMF (Product-Market Fit) journey. I‚Äôm learning a lot through this:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Good wine still needs marketing.

Even a one-week delay might cost you the moment. The goal isn‚Äôt to build something perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs to go from 0 to 1. You‚Äôll likely get something valuable out of it.</p> <p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Build your own distribution channels. Think of yourself as the maker‚Äîbut also the distributor.

I‚Äôve been heavily focused on MCP lately, and also experimenting with travel planning done directly via unwrapped LLMs. It gave me some new ideas for the product. I‚Äôm starting to believe that the moat for this type of travel planning product might lie in data:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ First, having a reliable and objective factual dataset can significantly suppress hallucinations and maximize the user experience. This is also a key reason why RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is so popular. I think many LLM-based vertical products can actually be classified as RAG applications.</p> <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Second, user data. With ChatGPT‚Äôs new Memory feature, I think we‚Äôre witnessing a real game-changer. Making users feel ‚Äúwow, this thing gets me‚Äù relies entirely on user data + data generated during usage.</p> <p>For products in this specific category, different monetization models will highlight different strengths ‚Äî for example, some might compete based on their supply chain. Just some food for thought.</p> <p>Current progress summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 33%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 60%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 56%</li> <li>Data: 14%</li> </ol> <p>If you feel like you fit the following description, let‚Äôs talk:</p> <ol> <li>You can stay committed</li> <li>You have a dream</li> <li>You‚Äôre genuinely interested</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 6Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 65/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-65-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 65/100days"/><published>2025-04-22T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-22T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-65-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-65-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day 6Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£</p> <p>Amap‚Äôs support for Flutter is honestly pretty disappointing ‚Äî the latest version (3.0.0) is still from three years ago. Feels kinda rough. For now, I‚Äôll make do with it and figure out a better solution later. The basic map rendering is more or less done. Currently, I‚Äôm using a simple ‚ÄúDay.N‚Äù format to represent point-to-point routes. In the future, I‚Äôll replace those with POI stickers. Up next is adding functionality to insert and remove stops in the itinerary. After that, I‚Äôll move on to the expense tracking module.</p> <p>Time really flies. Things have been pretty hectic lately, and progress has slowed down a bit. On top of that, a lot of teammates have been walking away one by one. It‚Äôs a familiar scene ‚Äî in the end, it‚Äôs rare to find people who truly walk the whole path with you. And that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll tweak things and keep pushing forward.</p> <p>Also, I recently open-sourced two AI-related projects, which got a lot of love from developers. I‚Äôm planning to carve out some dedicated time to grow one of them into a full-fledged SaaS service. That said, I‚Äôll still keep iterating on Iter-X. I‚Äôm just not sure if the original milestones can still be hit on time. But since I‚Äôve set off on this path, there‚Äôs no turning back ‚Äî this is the commitment and perseverance needed to walk a road less traveled.</p> <p>Mentally, I feel pretty great every day. Physically, though, my carbon-based body is having trouble keeping up. I went for my first swim of the year this afternoon, and I plan to swim twice a week moving forward. Gotta keep my body in shape to keep the output going strong.
