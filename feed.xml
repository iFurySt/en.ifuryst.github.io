Everyone is making progress in their respective areas, and we’ll push hard again this weekend. I also worked on the personal profile page a bit—this isn’t the final version yet, just putting in some content for now, and we’ll adjust the layout later.</p> <p>Today, I watched Lei Jun’s 2024 annual speech, and it resonated with me quite a bit. Overall, I have a lot of respect for him. While he’s undoubtedly a marketing genius, I still found some really genuine moments in his talk—especially his approach to making cars. To truly understand the industry, he test-drove over 170 cars, borrowing them from friends, taking 4S store test drives, and even asking strangers in parking lots. He also led his team to obtain racing licenses, experiencing racing firsthand. Betting everything on one final startup, constantly learning and expanding his knowledge—this level of dedication is something I deeply respect. It’s about truly loving what you do.</p> <p>He also mentioned a 21-day closed-door “argument session” with his core team, where they debated until they fully understood the direction before executing.</p> <p>This is perhaps the mindset every entrepreneur should have—stripping away the unnecessary fluff and just focusing on getting things done. There’s no need for grand, empty slogans or overly complex processes. What matters is full commitment from everyone involved. Larger companies often suffer from bureaucracy, pushing employees to become hyper-specialized in their roles. But in a fast-moving team, we need people to be more versatile, aligning under a shared vision to build momentum.</p> <p>Having a deep understanding of what you’re working on is crucial. Just like with our product—we need to first develop our own perspectives on travel before we can shape the product around those insights. Only then can we define our individual roles within this project.</p> <p>I also came across some great quotes about travel while reading a magazine today, but I forgot to take pictures. I’ll jot them down tomorrow and share them!</p> <p>Current Progress:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype Design &amp; UI/UX: 31%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 31%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Progress: 14%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>We’re Looking for a UI Designer 👾!</p> <p>If you match the following, let’s talk:</p> <ol> <li>Commitment</li> <li>Dreams</li> <li>Passion &amp; Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day3️⃣9️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 38/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-38-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 38/100days"/><published>2025-03-26T14:30:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-26T14:30:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-38-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-38-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day3️⃣8️⃣</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3"> <div class="row mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="row mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="row mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/cursor+figma.design3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/deepseek.design-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/deepseek.design-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/deepseek.design-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-26-iter-x-38-100/deepseek.design" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Cursor &amp; Figma Design(left), DeepSeek Design(right) </div> <p>Today I explored generating prototype images with AI: deepseek for HTML, and cursor + Figma for Figma designs. It provided some useful ideas, and prototyping exploration was helpful. However, the prompts still need some tuning. I’ll share a few of the results.</p> <p>I’ll continue exploring this area, with the ideal process being:</p> <ol> <li>Cursor + Figma to generate prototype or design images.</li> <li>Designers intervene to optimize and finalize the design.</li> <li>Then use Figma + Cursor to quickly generate code.</li> <li>Manual inspection and adjustments.</li> </ol> <p>This approach can help improve efficiency and is suitable for long-term, sustainable progress. It’s like that well-worn saying, “AI won’t replace you, but those who know how to use AI will replace you.” In the internet era, we used to say it’s no longer the time for big fish to eat small fish, but for fast fish to eat slow fish. I think this phrase is even more fitting for the AI era. The speed of AI advancements is beyond my imagination. I thought of the word “momentum,” which originally refers to kinetic energy in physics, but in news or articles, it’s often used to describe a project, team, or event’s development momentum. I think it’s a good fit for the AI era. While AI agents and MCPs are already last year’s things (I’ve thought about this: new technology takes time to flow from research to market, commercial, or public view. Many things last year were still in papers, and we’re part of the early adopters, so it feels a bit surreal and even confusing, but then it hits us—we realize the speed is just overwhelming), the applications emerging this year are coming faster and in greater numbers. If you can’t keep up, you won’t stay in place, but rather fall behind on the conveyor belt of time. The reason I work hard to absorb a lot of information, think, learn, and practice is to counter the rigidity that comes with age and experience.</p> <p>As for the team, today two new members joined, focusing on data and UI design. We’re now 15 people. Do you think that’s too many? Have you seen this kind of collaboration style?

The free credits are being replenished quickly, and it’s great for exploring ideas. AI-generated images are really useful for inspiration, but finding the right direction still requires personal input. There are still some issues with style consistency, for example, generating multiple scenes based on one character often yields unreliable results. However, images and videos are certainly hot areas right now.

Over the next couple of days, I’ll focus on infrastructure, and then we can start pushing the pages.</p> <p>I feel that the loose collaboration style is not ideal. It’s already difficult to find people who can stick with it, and with part-time work, everyone’s time and energy are unpredictable. On top of that, continuous input is needed, which really filters out most people. But I think this is an interesting phenomenon. This is my first time trying to attract others through social media. Watching everyone’s evolution from initial idea exchanges to different behaviors as time goes on has been a fascinating process. I think this kind of collaboration, combining open-source principles with social platforms, is very dynamic and helps with learning. It further validates my idea that entrepreneurship can’t just rely on close relationships; you can’t naively assume that your good friends are the best people to work with. Instead, you should look for that “one in a million” person. Perhaps this also indirectly explains why there are more solo entrepreneurs — finding the right partners is not easy. Is this a bit pessimistic? I’m still optimistic. I have a strong ability to balance my own emotions and pressures. When you want to attract and lead others toward a distant future, you need to be strong enough to handle most situations. When everyone else falls, you still have to stand. If you don’t have this mindset, then just close your laptop and enjoy a 9-to-5 job, balancing life and work.

You input “3-day trip to Hangzhou,” and it starts planning. It even outputs the reasoning process of the model. I suddenly felt a bit absurd – the user just entered these five words, and AI is already thinking? It feels almost magical. It doesn’t even ask for user preferences. Is this kind of forced reasoning really thinking? I feel like many product teams today are missing the point. It’s like the famous story of Steve Jobs talking to his engineers. Today, many teams make the same mistake: they prioritize technology over product. Essentially, it’s “AI first.” In reality, we should start from the user. Only then should we think about whether this technology is needed, where it’s needed, to what extent, and what it can achieve. This is the logical direction to consider. Of course, I understand that FOMO, KPIs, and other pressures can lead to this approach, but just because it’s “necessary” doesn’t mean it’s the right approach.</p> <p>I even think we should let AI have a certain attitude. For instance, if you provide too little information, we shouldn’t recommend anything. Because it’s easy to recommend incorrectly, and the outcome could be: 1) The user feels like it doesn’t work and quits. 2) The user manually deletes the recommendation. 3) Or the user keeps asking AI to optimize it. Essentially, we’re wasting computational power, which equals burning money to satisfy unclear needs, guessing user preferences in a labor-intensive way, which is not productive.</p> <p>If we must force AI to recommend based on such limited information, that’s fine. We can go with a safer, more generic approach. This can meet the needs of the majority of users, especially those visiting a place for the first time. The chances are they will want to see the more famous attractions.</p> <p>Another point is that recommendations need to be justified. The reason for recommending a specific POI should be clear to the user because users have the final decision. For example, when browsing travel spots on platforms like Xiaohongshu or social media, you don’t visit all the top 10 places. You will only go to those that interest you. The key is understanding why something interests you.</p> <p>I still think we need to return to the original goal: start with a useful itinerary planner, then make it smarter. Many products today only focus on a direction or a few points, but what users expect is a complete product. We want to deliver this complete product. Now, I actually feel happier and lighter because the real concern for me was the financial pressure AI would bring. If we can get our approach right, maybe we don’t need such high upfront costs to validate whether the market believes in our vision.</p> <p>Current status summary:</p> <ol> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX design: 29%</li> <li>Backend (Go) development: 30%</li> <li>Frontend (Flutter) progress: 8%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ol> <p>If you meet the following criteria, feel free to reach out (we need a UI design partner👾):</p> <ol> <li>Persistence</li> <li>Ambition</li> <li>Interest</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="products"/><category term="products"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day3️⃣4️⃣]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Iter-X] 33/100days</title><link href="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-33-100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Iter-X] 33/100days"/><published>2025-03-21T15:59:59+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-21T15:59:59+00:00</updated><id>https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-33-100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifuryst.github.io/blog/2025/iter-x-33-100/"><![CDATA[<p>Day3️⃣3️⃣</p> <p>No significant progress updates today—I’m still evaluating options for full-text search and haven’t finished yet.

Tomorrow, I’ll continue working on the AI workflow. I also had a chat with two product teammates, and along with my recent thoughts, I took some time to brainstorm ideas.</p> <p>Lately, I came across another person doing a “Build in Public 100 Days” challenge, also working on a travel app. Several friends mentioned it to me today and even asked if we were on the same team—haha. This also led me to write an article yesterday reflecting on our product, going back to the core idea, and defining why our product can survive in the market, what makes it different, and what value it brings to users. This actually helped me further clarify my thoughts. I believe delivering a good product to the market isn’t the hard part—survival is. Entering the travel planning app space sometimes feels like “seeking my own demise.” After all, the dominant players in this industry are OTAs (Online Travel Agencies), which hold the key B2B resources and have massive user bases—an enormous moat. On the other hand, many products that started as tools have struggled to monetize, leading to shutdowns. Another challenge is the low barrier to entry—many people can build similar products, and independent creators often go for small, niche, and paid products.</p> <p>So, why start despite all this? Anyone with some business knowledge can analyze these challenges, but I believe the world still needs a bit of irrationality and courage. Andrea used a word today that I found fitting—Utopia. Deep down, my rational self still holds a touch of impulsive passion, perhaps influenced by my wild, self-taught experience in the arts. I enjoy painting bold strokes of creativity against a logical backdrop.</p> <p>Right now, no single app allows me to fully manage my travel experience from start to finish. Travelers today are “Frankenstein users,” constantly piecing together information from different sources, recording bits here and there. Travel can be a one-time, fleeting joy or a lifelong collection of experiences—it all depends on how you define it. I want to create an app that I can use for a lifetime.</p> <p>Current Progress:</p> <ul> <li>Prototype &amp; UI/UX Design: 28%</li> <li>Backend (Go) Development: 27%</li> <li>Client (Flutter) Development: 8%</li> <li>Data: 8%</li> </ul> <p>If you match the following criteria, let’s talk!
