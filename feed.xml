This way, you can preview the design on your phone ahead of time. It gives a much more intuitive feel than viewing it on a computer. I went through all my pages this way today and found several design issues, especially with font weights, spacing, rectangle sizes, etc. I fixed all the problematic areas. On a large computer screen, everything looks fine because the high-fidelity images can be resized to any comfortable zoom level, but on the phone, it‚Äôs much more intuitive. You can immediately spot what doesn‚Äôt look right, and your instincts will tell you what needs fixing.</p> <p>I also managed to write a few pages of a PowerPoint because tomorrow is my first meetup. I hope to connect with everyone and take the opportunity to review why I started working on this product, along with some related ideas and features.

Over the next few days, I‚Äôll gradually define these specifications and go back to correct the earlier designs.</p> <p>Today, my teammate combined the design mockups with code and after reviewing around ten market competitors, we‚Äôve compiled a mind map with some functional and interaction frameworks. We plan to discuss this in our meetup on Sunday. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll organize the product background, philosophy, and goals to align everyone on the same page. I expect to finish the trip-focused design next week, and if everything goes smoothly, we can start backend and frontend development, and also integrate AI. Currently, we are considering the AI integration, especially where it fits in and how to define its boundaries.

When jumping straight into coding, you can work with vague ideas, but if you need to make adjustments during the implementation, the cost becomes quite high. On the other hand, dragging and dropping elements in Figma requires much less effort, and sometimes you can experiment and expand your thoughts.</p> <p>Although I‚Äôve worked on many projects before, this time I‚Äôve taken a more serious approach to design, controlling the details and thinking about interactions from scratch. I can‚Äôt help but feel that even the simplest MVP requires a lot of effort, and I have great respect for solo founders. Recently, I‚Äôve noticed a phenomenon on several platforms‚Äîmany people are very FOMO (especially during the period when I was inspired by DeepSeek). They‚Äôre anxious, scared that they‚Äôll fall behind after just a day or two and miss the opportunity to make money. However, some things just can‚Äôt be rushed. Although the startup market is all about racing against time, fearing that a second could mean losing the market, I still lean toward a long-term approach. Technology moves in waves, and you never know which wave will be the biggest or the one that helps you stand up. What you can do is keep sharpening yourself on the sea. You only need to catch a wave or two and manage to stand up‚Äîthen it‚Äôs enough. Always remember, the tide will eventually go out, and how many will be left with their pants down?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip1.2025-03-02_21-09-34.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Creation Page Design </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip2.2025-03-02_21-09-14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-0 mb-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2025-03-02-iter-x-14-100/CreateTrip3.2025-03-02_21-09-21.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption mt-0"> Trip Creation Page Design </div> <p>Today, I turned an idea for a city selection page into reality, and it feels great. I love the feeling of creation, like coding or painting‚Äîcreating something from nothing. I enjoy it! I had originally planned to outsource the design, but since I shifted my focus to academics and exam prep, I had to take this responsibility on myself. I think it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise, as it allows me to fully bring my ideas to life. Though at times I‚Äôve struggled with my aesthetics and design skills, I still strive to learn from excellent and eye-catching designs. I also often talk with designers I know to get feedback on my ideas and ask for help. However, I‚Äôve realized that design is really subjective; each designer‚Äôs style is unique. So, I often don‚Äôt agree with some design ideas, and it leads to lots of back-and-forth discussions and revisions. But it‚Äôs also great‚Äîsometimes we exchange ideas, try things out, and new results come out of it.

One of them was:</p> <p>‚ÄúOne further point in our CEO selections: I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!‚Äù</p> <p>In essence, he does not consider a candidate‚Äôs school background when choosing a CEO. Despite having studied at three prestigious schools himself, he firmly believes in lifelong learning. Many business geniuses don‚Äôt need academic credentials to prove themselves. The business world naturally fosters talented people through experience.</p> <p>I‚Äôm also a strong advocate for lifelong learning. I always believe that broad learning can unlock infinite potential. Modern society has categorized various disciplines, transforming people into specialists, which makes sense for maximizing social efficiency as complexity increases. (However, the social optimum doesn‚Äôt always equal the individual optimum.)</p> <p>This easily traps most people into a preconceived notion, creating barriers that are so ingrained that we never question them. I remember Da Vinci as a polymath who excelled across several fields. I think in this AI-powered era, the potential to accumulate and learn information is far beyond what the internet era could offer. If you want to learn, you can access nearly all of humanity‚Äôs knowledge‚Äî the only barrier to learning is within yourself. The obsession with degrees is merely a way for employers to reduce hiring costs in the job market. It‚Äôs not the only standard and certainly not an objective one. Don‚Äôt let degrees or academic fields blind you‚Äî your boundaries may go far beyond that.</p> <p>Recently, several people have asked if they can join, and as I mentioned in my previous co-creation initiative, it‚Äôs not about whether you can join. If you‚Äôre willing to try, you‚Äôre welcome. We maintain an open mindset to welcome everyone and also respect those who choose to leave silently.</p> <p>A new member who can draw has joined today and will help with some of the design tasks üéâ</p> <p>Today, I further refined the details of the daily itinerary page and began adding the location pages.
